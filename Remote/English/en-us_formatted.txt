RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_03
TEXT: These mighty Warrior Pokémon achieved legendary feats in their time. I'm excited to dig into this development further.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_04_branch
TEXT: Which one should we look into?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_00_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_00_sword
TEXT: Alright, now is the time to strike! Let me recall my notes on Zacian..

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_01_shield
TEXT: In times past, Zamazenta worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_01_sword
TEXT: Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_02_shield
TEXT: A noble feat! From what, I wonder? Perhaps a question for another day.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_02_sword
TEXT: Very impressive. I wonder if Zacian could teach my Meltan how to do that? It does absorb metal as well...

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_03_shield
TEXT: Let's work on finding Zamazenta first. Take a look around and let me know what you find!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_03_sword
TEXT: Ah! I'm jumping ahead of myself. Let's work on finding Zacian first. If we split up our search, we can cut our time in half. Meet back here in a bit!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_00_shield
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! No sign of Zamazenta for me, though I did find some new information on it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_00_sword
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! No Zacian sightings for me, though I did find some new information on it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_01_shield
TEXT: This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long people forgot that it ever existed.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_01_sword
TEXT: This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it's Zamazenta's elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals. What do you think, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_02_shield
TEXT: Well, I can relate. I like a restorative afternoon nap myself. And if you ask Meltan, it would probably tell you I sleep like a statue.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_02_sword
TEXT: Haha, you're right! Who's to say they can't be both? I like your sharp thinking.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_shield
TEXT: Anyway, Zamazenta won't be forgotten for much longer. I've got a good feeling!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_sword
TEXT: Let's keep looking. Chaaaaarge!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_00_shield
TEXT: Splendid, you've found Zamazenta! It is certainly a sight to behold.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_00_sword
TEXT: Magnificent, you've found Zacian! Goodness, it truly "steels" the show.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_01_shield
TEXT: Can you believe it has another impressive form as well? With its shield Zamazenta transforms into its Crowned Shield Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_01_sword
TEXT: Can you believe it has another impressive form as well? When armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, Zacian transforms into its Crowned Sword Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_02_shield
TEXT: In this form it can shrug off impressive blows, including the attacks of Dynamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_02_sword
TEXT: It needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_03_shield
TEXT: I'm sure such incredible defensive power will give you a solid advantage in a Max Battle soon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_03_sword
TEXT: I'm sure such incredible power will give you quite the edge in a Max Battle soon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_00_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_00_sword
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I've been thinking about Zacian and its Crowned Sword Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_shield
TEXT: Its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master's Shield.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_sword
TEXT: Able to cut down anything with a single strike, it became known as the Fairy King's Sword. It inspired awe in friend and foe alike.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_02_shield
TEXT: I'd be keen to observe it in a Max Battle, if you're up for it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_02_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_01_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_02_shield
TEXT: Whatever challenges may come your way in the future, I know you and Zamazenta can take on anything together.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_02_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_00
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! What an exciting day we have ahead of us!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_01
TEXT: There's something heartwarming about watching Trainers connect, catching new Pokémon and making new friends.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_02
TEXT: I've noticed something curious though - a strange fog is rolling in. While I'm not exactly sure what this phenomenon means yet, it certainly warrants investigation.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_03
TEXT: Have fun exploring and we'll reconvene later to discuss my findings.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I've been monitoring that mysterious fog, and while there are no new updates, I have discovered something else equally fascinating during my research!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_01
TEXT: The Pokémon seem to be gathering around four distinct habitats, each with its own unique characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_02
TEXT: I've observed Wooloo doting Noble Fields, red and blue Basculin near Sunken Treasure, and even a Heracross at the nearby Carnival Grounds.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_03
TEXT: There's also a fourth habitat that I haven't had the chance to explore yet!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_04
TEXT: Which habitat will your research take you to first? The choice is yours, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_00
TEXT: Impressive work on that first habitat! Point us toward our next discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_01
TEXT: Another habitat successfully investigated! Where to next, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_02
TEXT: Remarkable work, %PLAYERNAME%! Only one more habitat remains unexplored.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_00
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! After analyzing the mysterious fog, I've found evidence suggesting the presence of the mythical steam Pokemon, Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_01
TEXT: I was digging into my notes right before you arrived. Did you know that Volcanion harnesses water to create steam?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_02
TEXT: To learn more about this elusive Pokémon, I need you to study other Water-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_03
TEXT: Pay particular attention if they can also regulate their internal water reservoirs and control temperature. Each observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_00
TEXT: Incredible progress with your Water-type research! Now, to continue our understanding of Volcanion, we need to focus on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_01
TEXT: Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon that is both Fire and Water type, understanding how it manages these opposing elements is crucial to our research.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_02
TEXT: I'd like you to observe Fire-type Pokémon in their natural habitats - pay close attention to what mechanisms they use to prevent overheating.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_03
TEXT: These observations will help us understand Volcanion's remarkable dual typing! Your fieldwork continues to be essential to our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_00
TEXT: Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to your research on both Water and Fire-type Pokémon, we now have a much clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_01
TEXT: Our next challenge is perhaps the most important yet - we need to show Volcanion that you're a trustworthy trainer! Let's focus on demonstrating your exceptional care for Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_02
TEXT: When Volcanion witnesses the kindness and respect you show to your Pokémon companions, it will surely recognize the goodness in your heart.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_03
TEXT: Your gentle approach could make all the difference in our ability to encounter this elusive Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_00
TEXT: Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many thought impossible - you've successfully gained Volcanion's trust!
