RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_03
TEXT: These mighty Warrior Pokémon achieved legendary feats in their time, so you’d better believe I’m excited to dig into this!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_04_branch
TEXT: Which of the two piques your interest?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_00_shield
TEXT: Right, let's go on the defensive! Let me recall my notes on Zamazenta..

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_00_sword
TEXT: A bold approach. You’re right—now’s the time to strike! Let me see what notes I have on Zacian...

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_01_shield
TEXT: In times past, Zamazenta worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_01_sword
TEXT: Here we are. Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_02_shield
TEXT: A noble feat! From what, I wonder? Perhaps a question for another day.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_02_sword
TEXT: Very impressive. I wonder if Zacian could teach my Meltan how to do that.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_03_shield
TEXT: Let's work on finding Zamazenta first. Take a look around and let me know what you find!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_03_sword
TEXT: But I’m jumping ahead of myself! Let’s find Zacian first. If we split up to search, we can go twice as fast. See you in a bit!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_00_shield
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! No sign of Zamazenta for me, though I did find some new information on it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_00_sword
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! No Zacian sightings for me, though I did find some new information.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_01_shield
TEXT: This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long people forgot that it ever existed.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_01_sword
TEXT: Supposedly, Zacian slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister, but others say the two are rivals. What do you think?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_02_shield
TEXT: Well, I can relate. I like a restorative afternoon nap myself. And if you ask Meltan, it would probably tell you I sleep like a statue.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_02_sword
TEXT: Well, who’s to say they can’t be both? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_shield
TEXT: Anyway, Zamazenta won't be forgotten for much longer. I've got a good feeling!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_sword
TEXT: Either way, nobody finds anything without looking. Chaaaaarge!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_00_shield
TEXT: Splendid, you've found Zamazenta! It is certainly a sight to behold.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_00_sword
TEXT: Magnificent! You’ve found Zacian! Goodness, it truly “steels” the show.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_01_shield
TEXT: Can you believe it has another impressive form as well? With its shield Zamazenta transforms into its Crowned Shield Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_01_sword
TEXT: Can you believe it has another impressive form as well? When armed with the weapon it used in ancient times, Zacian transforms into its Crowned Sword form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_02_shield
TEXT: In this form it can shrug off impressive blows, including the attacks of Dynamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_02_sword
TEXT: I’ve heard that in that form, it can fell even Gigantamax Pokémon with a single strike. I don’t know if I believe that!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_03_shield
TEXT: I'm sure such incredible defensive power will give you a solid advantage in a Max Battle soon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_03_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_00_shield
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I've been thinking about Zamazenta and its Crowned Shield Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_00_sword
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve been learning more about Zacian and its Crowned Sword form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_shield
TEXT: Its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master's Shield.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_sword
TEXT: According to my research, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, inspiring awe in friend and foe alike.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_02_shield
TEXT: I'd be keen to observe it in a Max Battle, if you're up for it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_02_sword
TEXT: I’m not sure I understand the first part, but the second seems true enough! I’m keen to observe it in a Max Battle, if you’re up for it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_01_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_01_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_02_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_02_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_00
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! What an exciting day we have ahead of us.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_01
TEXT: Isn’t there something heartwarming about watching Trainers catch new Pokémon and make new friends?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_02
TEXT: But I’ve noticed something curious—a strange fog is rolling in. While I’m not sure what this phenomenon means yet, it certainly warrants investigation.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_03
TEXT: So let’s get to it! Have fun exploring, and we’ll reconvene later to discuss our findings.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back! I’ve been monitoring that mysterious fog. There are no updates, but I discovered something quite fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_01
TEXT: Pokémon seem to be gathering around four distinct habitats, each with its own unique characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_02
TEXT: I've observed Wooloo frolicking in local fields, Basculin with red and blue stripes swimming around an underwater trove, and even a Heracross running around a nearby carnival.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_03
TEXT: There’s also a fourth habitat that I haven’t had the chance to explore yet!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_04
TEXT: Where will your research take you first? The choice is yours, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_00
TEXT: Impressive work on that first habitat! Point us toward our next discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_01
TEXT: Another habitat successfully investigated! Where to next, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_02
TEXT: Remarkable work, %PLAYERNAME%! Only one more habitat left to explore.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_00
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! After analyzing the mysterious fog, I’ve found evidence suggesting a mythic presence—the Steam Pokémon, Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_01
TEXT: I was going over my notes right before you arrived. Did you know that Volcanion harnesses water to create steam?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_02
TEXT: To learn more about this elusive Pokémon, I’d like you to dive into studying other Water types.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_03
TEXT: See what you can learn about their internal water reservoirs or temperature regulation. Each observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_00
TEXT: Incredible progress with your soggy survey! Now let’s turn our attention to Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_01
TEXT: Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon that is both Fire- and Water-type, understanding how it manages these opposing elements is crucial.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_02
TEXT: I’d like you to turn up the heat on observing Fire types in their natural habitats. Pay close attention to what mechanisms they use to prevent overheating.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_03
TEXT: This will help us to better understand Volcanion’s remarkable dual typing. Your fieldwork continues to be essential, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_00
TEXT: Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Your research on both Water and Fire types gives us a clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_01
TEXT: Our next challenge is perhaps the most important yet— we need to show Volcanion that you’re a trustworthy Trainer. Let’s focus on demonstrating your exceptional care for Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_02
TEXT: When Volcanion witnesses the kindness and respect you show to your Pokémon companions, it will surely recognize the goodness in your heart.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_03
TEXT: Your gentle approach could make all the difference in our ability to encounter this elusive Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_00
TEXT: Phenomenal job as always! Your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many thought impossible—you’ve gained Volcanion’s trust!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_01
TEXT: I encourage you to spend quality time with this Mythical Pokémon. Grow that special bond that only comes from understanding and respecting each other.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_02
TEXT: This journey has expanded our understanding of Pokémon. The connection between Trainers and Pokémon is truly our ultimate research tool!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_03
TEXT: Your experience with Volcanion will inspire Trainers everywhere. I couldn’t be prouder, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_00
TEXT: Ahoy, %PLAYERNAME%! Prepare yourself to dive into the depths of this watery habitat. I’m sure you already feel the thrill of adventure washing over you.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_01
TEXT: The true treasures in these waters aren’t gold doubloons or precious gems, but the remarkable Pokémon that call this place home.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_02
TEXT: Those twinkling lights in the distance may be the passing glow of an Inkay, or the shining tail fins of a Finneon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_03
