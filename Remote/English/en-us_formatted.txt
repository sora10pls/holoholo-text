RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_01
TEXT: Several Trainers across the region claim to have seen something strange going on with their shadows.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_02
TEXT: I’m pretty sure the reports align with something I put down in my older research, but I have to find my notes before I can confirm my theory.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_03
TEXT: If you’re up for it, let’s go with a tried-and-true play: I’ll search my archives, and you can go out and investigate. Your field observations could prove invaluable!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_00
TEXT: Yo, %PLAYERNAME%! You looking for the prof? He just bolted by a second ago. He had a big old notebook with him!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_01

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_02
TEXT: But hey, if you wanted to take a break from shadow-hunting, we could hang a bit, trade some battle strats, maybe grab a quick snack?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_03
TEXT: No? Yeah, I guess you’re right, finding Professor Willow is probably the priority!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_00
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. I see my appearance has caught you off guard. Rest assured, you did not startle me.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_01
TEXT: You’re looking for Professor Willow, correct? I saw him moments ago, though his behavior was somewhat...unusual. It looked as though he was tracking something through the shadows, off in that direction.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_02
TEXT: These shadowy anomalies you’ve likely heard about—I’ve been studying them myself, though my observations have yet to yield definitive conclusions.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_03
TEXT: Perhaps your own investigation will prove more fruitful. But be cautious, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_00
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You after Professor Willow, too?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_01

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_03

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_00
TEXT: Found you at last, %PLAYERNAME%! We must’ve been walking right past each other in all these shadows.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_01
TEXT: I’ve cross-referenced our recent field data against my old notes, and I managed to identify the source of these mysterious occurrences!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_02
TEXT: A powerful presence is out there, observing Trainers and their Pokémon. Based on the data, it should be nearby, too.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_03
TEXT: We’re looking at a massive research opportunity here—and you’re the perfect Trainer for the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_04
TEXT: Get out there and investigate the thing that’s causing all these odd shadows—but remember to be careful. We don’t know for sure what lies in the darkness!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_00
TEXT: Exceptional work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_01
TEXT: The strange shadows were actually the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow, hiding in plain sight! Well, plain-ish.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_02
TEXT: Following its trail through the darkness got us closer than we realized, but it took someone with your special connection to Pokémon to finally draw it into the light.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_03
