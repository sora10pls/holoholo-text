RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%! I’d like to take a break to tell you the fascinating tale of Keldeo, the Colt Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: And if you’ve heard it before, well, it’s even better the second time around!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Long ago, Keldeo joined forces with Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion, who taught it the ways of battle. Keldeo dashed across the world, seeking opportunities to grow stronger.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: That sounds like a certain Trainer I know… And now for the good news: rumors say that Keldeo has been spotted in the area! So let’s get out there and write the next chapter.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s wonderful to see you with Keldeo! My research has uncovered something remarkable—our friend has a true power that has yet to awaken!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Just as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion once guided Keldeo, now it’s your turn to help it grow and reveal its immense potential.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Training with such a remarkable Pokémon isn’t just beneficial for Keldeo. It’s also a chance to strengthen your own skills!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I’ll continue gathering information on our friend Keldeo while you saddle up and get ready to train!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m eager to hear about the progress with your remarkable companion. Have you seen Keldeo blast water from its hooves yet?

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: This allows it to glide across bodies of water. It can even run over oceans and rivers! No need for boats with a skill like that.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure Keldeo is perfecting these natural talents with you and is getting closer to awakening its true power!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: Keep up the momentum, %PLAYERNAME%. You’re witnessing something truly extraordinary!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: As you’ve likely noticed, Keldeo has two types: Water and Fighting! This rare and powerful combination makes Keldeo incredibly versatile in battle.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Few Pokémon can master both the fluid grace of water techniques and the raw intensity of fighting moves quite like Keldeo.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Understanding these type advantages will be crucial to helping Keldeo reach its full potential. Now hoof it and put this knowledge to good use!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember when we discussed the true power waiting to be awakened within Keldeo? Through my research, I’ve discovered a little more about this power within our friend.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: When Keldeo strengthens its resolve for battle, it fills its body with power and changes into its Resolute Form.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: In this form, it becomes so swift that its jumps are too fast to follow!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Keep pushing forward in your training, %PLAYERNAME%. You may be closer to witnessing this transformation than you think!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve been reading more about Keldeo’s Resolute Form. It’s fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: The power that lay hidden in its body covers its horn, turning it into a sword that can slice through anything.

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: With power like that, I’d say Keldeo’s really making the cut!

RESOURCE ID: season20_keldeo_story_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: I have a feeling that with your support, Keldeo will soon be ready to take this monumental step forward.
