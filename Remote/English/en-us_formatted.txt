RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excuse the mess—I’m looking for some notes.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: I received an interesting report about a Pokémon today. The witness only caught a glimpse, but from the description, it could be something special.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: I have a theory that it’s a Pokémon originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: I’m trying to dig up some old research to corroborate my hunch, but I haven’t had much luck. Would you like to help? Don’t worry, I’ll handle the paperwork!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_04
TEXT: I’d like you to brush up on Pokémon from Kalos. In the meantime, I’ll try to pick out the diamond in this rough!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: I knew you’d deliver—you’re a superstar!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: How did I do? Well, I almost have my notes organized, but I’ll need more time to actually find what I’m looking for.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: It’s easy to forget to check the clock when I’m poring over old research.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Anyhow, that’s my problem. Why don’t you spend some more time in the field while I keep digging?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_00
TEXT: Success! I’ve got my notes in order! Now, let’s get down to it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01
TEXT: The report mentioned that the Pokémon in question was jewel-like. Could it be a Carbink?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02
TEXT: Jewels mean sparkles, and sparkles make me think of Fairy types. That might be what we’re searching for.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_03
TEXT: Haha, I know that look! You’re ready to dive into adventure!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m stuck between a Rock- and a Fairy-type place.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: I was reviewing my notes on Fairy-type Pokémon from the Kalos region, but none of them are a perfect fit.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: Jewels can get confused with rocks, so...maybe the Pokémon we’re looking for is a Rock type?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: So, let’s study Rock types next! We’re so close to crystallizing this information. I can feel it!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_00
TEXT: Astounding work out there! I think we’re truly onto something now.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01
TEXT: It seems like Fairy type and Rock type are both possibilities at this point. Which could it be?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_02
TEXT: The answer is—unsurprisingly—more learning! Let’s keep looking into both types. Surely that’ll make our answer crystal clear.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_03
TEXT: The pressure’s on now! But I know you can handle it, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_00
TEXT: You’ve been putting your all into this research, %PLAYERNAME%, but I think we might’ve run into a wall.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_01
TEXT: Why don’t we take a break and relax for a bit? Maybe you’ll end up running into our elusive Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_02
TEXT: Meltan and I will take a walk and do some pondering before we continue our work.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_03
TEXT: I’m sure your Pokémon would love to spend time with you, too!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_00
TEXT: I see you’ve found a Carbink! That’s great, though now that I get a closer look, it doesn’t match the reports.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_01
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%... What if we’ve been searching for the Mythical Pokémon Diancie this whole time?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_02
TEXT: Some speculate that Diancie is the result of a Carbink’s sudden transformation, so that could explain the similarities.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_03
TEXT: This treasure hunt isn’t over yet!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_07_00
TEXT: Exciting news, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_07_01
TEXT: I just caught a glimpse of what I’m sure is Diancie! But its coloring seemed unusual, so I’ll need to take a closer look.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_07_02
TEXT: What a dazzling opportunity! I knew if we kept mining for answers we’d strike it big.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_07_03
TEXT: Let’s get back out there and see what we can find.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_08_00
TEXT: You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! And what a unique color! Incredible!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_08_01
TEXT: Did you know Diancie can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_08_02
TEXT: Marvelous to be sure, but there’s still plenty more to be learned about Diancie.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_08_03
TEXT: And I know you’re the best Trainer to help it reach its full potential!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_09_00
TEXT: Diancie looks like it’s taken quite a shine to you. In fact, it looks ready to Mega Evolve!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2026_masterwork_sr_dialog_09_01
TEXT: I’ve recently heard Mega Diancie is also known as the Royal Pink Princess. The dazzling diamond on its forehead is a whopping 2,000 carats!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_dialog_02_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_dialog_02_01
TEXT: After all, the most meaningful stories aren’t just about the ancient past—they’re also about the relationships we have with our Pokémon today!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_dialog_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_01_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_04_01
TEXT: Xerneas is the Life Pokémon, and its counterpart, Yveltal, is the Destruction Pokémon. One shares life energy, while the other absorbs it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_04_02
TEXT: It makes you wonder how they feel about each other. Are they enemies...or do they work together?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_kalos_global_sr_xerneas_dialog_04_03

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_00_01
TEXT: I was on my morning walk today when I encountered the most remarkable fog. It was so dense and thick, I could barely see my walking buddy Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_00_02
TEXT: Naturally, that got me thinking about Volcanion, the Steam Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_00_03
TEXT: Of course, the fog on my walk was only caused by cool morning temperatures—but I still couldn’t get Volcanion off my mind.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_00_04
TEXT: There’s little documented about it, which makes it an ideal candidate for further study! Why don’t you head out and explore while I put together a research plan?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s time for some facts! Volcanion is both Fire- and Water-type—what a remarkable combo!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_01_01
TEXT: Its fascinating nature got me thinking—what type of environment could support such a unique Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_01_02
TEXT: What scant documentation I have suggests Volcanion inhabits remote mountain regions, far from humans. Maybe it’s just looking for a nice, secluded retreat?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_01_03
TEXT: I’m picturing geothermal hot springs, volcanic areas near the ocean... Okay, maybe I’m just dreaming about where I’d like to vacation!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_01_04
TEXT: Enough about that, though! Let’s dig into what kinds of habitats are suited to Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_02_00
TEXT: Quality field work, %PLAYERNAME%! Now, for more facts!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_02_01
TEXT: Here’s a key one: Volcanion can create steam from water.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_02_02
TEXT: Which means I’d like you to go and observe Water-type Pokémon in their natural habitats, so that we can gain a better understanding of Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_02_03
TEXT: And try to pay particular attention to how they interact with water, like how Popplio creates water balloons with its nose!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_02_04
TEXT: Every observation brings us closer to understanding. Now, head on out and gather as much data as you can. I’ll be waiting for a report on your findings!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_03_00
TEXT: Outstanding work with your observations, %PLAYERNAME%! This is a good time to turn our attention to the other half of the equation: Fire-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_03_01
TEXT: It’s a fascinating puzzle, actually. How does a Pokémon maintain both fire and water without one canceling out the other?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_03_02
TEXT: And to solve the puzzle—you guessed it—I need you to study Fire types in the field!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_03_03
TEXT: For example, watch how a Pokémon like Fuecoco absorbs heat through its scales. Those kinds of observations might help us learn more about Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_03_04
TEXT: Now get out there and embrace discovery!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_04_00
TEXT: Wonderful job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Your observations on Water- and Fire-type Pokémon have given us valuable insights that’ll help us understand Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_04_01
TEXT: How lucky are we that our world is filled with such fascinating Pokémon? There’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_04_02
TEXT: I’m going to finish that walk with Meltan. Why don’t you head out and enjoy some quality time with your own Pokémon friends?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_04_03
TEXT: Spending time together can deepen your understanding of Pokémon in ways that research alone just can’t capture.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_04_04
TEXT: Oh, but be careful in the fog out there! You never know what you’ll find.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_05_00
TEXT: Stellar work as always, %PLAYERNAME%! I couldn’t ask for a better research partner.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_05_01
TEXT: The work you’ve done observing Water and Fire types and your own Pokémon have given us valuable insights into Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_volcanion_dialogue_05_02
