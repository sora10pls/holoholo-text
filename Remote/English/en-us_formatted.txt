TEXT: I’ve picked up some interesting stories in all the hubbub. Get a load of this!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_02
TEXT: I swapped notes with a researcher from another region, and they shared their own findings about Zacian and Zamazenta.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_04_branch
TEXT: Now, tell me—which of the two most piques your interest?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_00_shield
TEXT: All right then, brace yourself! Let me see what notes I have on Zamazenta.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_00_sword
TEXT: A bold approach. You’re right—now’s the time to strike! Let me see what my notes say about Zacian...

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_01_shield
TEXT: Here we go. “In times past, Zamazenta worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region.”

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_02_shield
TEXT: What a noble feat! But save Galar from what, I wonder? Something to ask about if we ever meet it, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_03_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_03_sword

TEXT: Exactly! It’s a Fairy type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_02_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_03_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_00_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_01_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_01_sword
TEXT: When armed with the weapon it wielded in ancient times, Zacian takes on its Crowned Sword form and becomes both Fairy and Steel type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_02_shield

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_00
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! What an exciting day it is! And it’s about to get even more exciting, because I have some extraordinary news!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_01
TEXT: I came across an unusual fog during my morning walk. I’ve got a hunch this could mean the Mythical Pokémon Volcanion is nearby.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_02
TEXT: You see, Volcanion is the only known Fire- and Water-type Pokémon, and it lets out billows of steam.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_03
TEXT: You head out and explore, and I’ll analyze the fog’s composition. Enjoy some adventure, and we’ll meet up later to compare findings!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. No news on the fog, but it’s got me thinking about how the environment changes what Pokémon we find.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_01
TEXT: Which, of course, presents the perfect opportunity for research! We can gather valuable data if we track hourly changes in Pokémon habitats.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_02
TEXT: And those observations could help us glean crucial insights into Volcanion’s habitat preferences and behaviors.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_03
TEXT: Which brings us to your part. Why don’t you get out there and investigate these habitat changes?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_01
TEXT: Given that we’re investigating Pokémon that use water, I’d like you to study some Water types in their natural habitats.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_02
TEXT: See what you can learn about the ways in which they adapt to their environments.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_03
TEXT: Every observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion! I’m counting on you, my friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_00
TEXT: You’ve made some incredible progress on your soggy survey, so let’s turn our attention to Fire types.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_01
TEXT: Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon to be both Fire- and Water-type, it’s critical that we understand how it behaves.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_02
TEXT: Let’s observe Fire types in their natural habitats. And try to pay close attention to the mechanisms they use to keep from overheating.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_03
TEXT: The conclusions we draw will help us understand Volcanion. Remember, your fieldwork is essential, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_00
TEXT: Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Your survey of Water and Fire types has given us a clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_01
TEXT: Now, our next challenge might be the most important yet. We’ve got to show Volcanion that you’re a Trainer who can be trusted. Let’s focus on demonstrating your incredible care for Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_02
TEXT: I’m sure when Volcanion sees the kindness and respect you show your Pokémon companions, it’ll recognize the goodness in your heart.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_03
TEXT: Your approach could make all the difference in our chances of encountering this elusive Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_00
TEXT: Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many might’ve thought impossible—you’ve gained Volcanion’s trust!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_01
TEXT: Try to spend some quality time with this Mythical Pokémon and grow the special bond that only comes from mutual understanding and respect.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_02
TEXT: Our understanding of Pokémon has really grown thanks to this journey. The connection between Trainers and Pokémon is truly the ultimate research tool!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_03

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_shield
