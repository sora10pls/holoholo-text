TEXT: It’s great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! With all the talented Trainers and Pokémon around, it feels like legends are afoot!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_01
TEXT: I’ve picked up some interesting stories in all the hubbub. Get a load of this!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_02
TEXT: I swapped notes with a researcher from another region, and they shared their own findings about Zacian and Zamazenta.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_03
TEXT: These mighty Warrior Pokémon achieved legendary feats in their time, so you’d better believe I’m excited to dig into this!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_00_04_branch
TEXT: Now, tell me—which of the two most piques your interest?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_00_shield
TEXT: All right then, brace yourself! Let me see what notes I have on Zamazenta.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_00_sword
TEXT: A bold approach. You’re right—now’s the time to strike! Let me see what my notes say about Zacian...

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_01_shield
TEXT: Here we go. “In times past, Zamazenta worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region.”

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_01_sword
TEXT: Here we are. Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_02_shield
TEXT: What a noble feat! But save Galar from what, I wonder? Something to ask about if we ever meet it, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_02_sword
TEXT: Very impressive. I wonder if Zacian could teach my Meltan how to do that.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_03_shield
TEXT: Now here’s a question I do have the answer to, though: What type of Pokémon is Hero of Many Battles Zamazenta? Any guesses?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_01_03_sword
TEXT: Now, with this talk of metal, you might think Hero of Many Battles Zacian is a Steel type—but it’s actually not! Any guesses?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_00_shield
TEXT: Figured out what type of Pokémon Zamazenta is, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_00_sword
TEXT: Figured out what type of Pokémon Zacian is, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_01_shield
TEXT: Right you are! It’s a Fighting type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_01_sword
TEXT: Exactly! It’s a Fairy type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_02_shield
TEXT: According to legends, this Pokémon slept for aeons in statue form. It slept for so long, people forgot that it ever existed.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_02_sword
TEXT: Supposedly, Zacian slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister, but others say the two are rivals. What do you think?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_03_shield
TEXT: Saving the entire Galar region would make anyone need a little shut-eye. In fact, I might take a nice nap of my own! Let’s catch up later.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_02_03_sword
TEXT: Well, I’m sure any sibling would tell you they can be both! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_00_shield
TEXT: Hi again! I’m...*yawn*...feeling nice and refreshed! Now, where were we? Ah, yes—can you believe Zamazenta has another impressive form?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_00_sword
TEXT: Can you believe that Zacian actually has another impressive form?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_01_shield
TEXT: When wielding its shield, Zamazenta takes on its Crowned Shield form and becomes both Fighting and Steel type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_01_sword
TEXT: When armed with the weapon it wielded in ancient times, Zacian takes on its Crowned Sword form and becomes both Fairy and Steel type!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_02_shield
TEXT: In that form, it can shrug off impressive blows—even Dynamax Pokémon attacks! Talk about “steel-ing” the show!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_03_02_sword
TEXT: I hear that in that form, it can fell even Gigantamax Pokémon with a single strike. Talk about “steel-ing” the show!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_04_01_shield
TEXT: According to my research, its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master’s Shield. Now, how would you go about finding weaknesses in its defense?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_04_01_sword
TEXT: According to my research, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, inspiring awe in friend and foe alike. Now, how would you go about taking on such a formidable opponent?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_04_02_shield
TEXT: As I mentioned, Crowned Shield Zamazenta is both Steel and Fighting type. And do you know what Steel types are weak against?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_swsh_05_01_sword

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_00
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! What an exciting day it is! And it’s about to get even more exciting, because I have some extraordinary news!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_01
TEXT: I came across an unusual fog during my morning walk. I’ve got a hunch this could mean the Mythical Pokémon Volcanion is nearby.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_02
TEXT: You see, Volcanion is the only known Fire- and Water-type Pokémon, and it lets out billows of steam.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_00_03
TEXT: You head out and explore, and I’ll analyze the fog’s composition. Enjoy some adventure, and we’ll meet up later to compare findings!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. No news on the fog, but it’s got me thinking about how the environment changes what Pokémon we find.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_01
TEXT: Which, of course, presents the perfect opportunity for research! We can gather valuable data if we track hourly changes in Pokémon habitats.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_02
TEXT: And those observations could help us glean crucial insights into Volcanion’s habitat preferences and behaviors.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_03
TEXT: Which brings us to your part. Why don’t you get out there and investigate these habitat changes?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_00
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_01
TEXT: Given that we’re investigating Pokémon that use water, I’d like you to study some Water types in their natural habitats.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_02
TEXT: See what you can learn about the ways in which they adapt to their environments.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_02_03
TEXT: Every observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion! I’m counting on you, my friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_00
TEXT: You’ve made some incredible progress on your soggy survey, so let’s turn our attention to Fire types.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_01
TEXT: Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon to be both Fire- and Water-type, it’s critical that we understand how it behaves.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_02
TEXT: Let’s observe Fire types in their natural habitats. And try to pay close attention to the mechanisms they use to keep from overheating.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_03
TEXT: The conclusions we draw will help us understand Volcanion. Remember, your fieldwork is essential, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_00
TEXT: Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Your survey of Water and Fire types has given us a clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_01
TEXT: Now, our next challenge might be the most important yet. We’ve got to show Volcanion that you’re a Trainer who can be trusted. Let’s focus on demonstrating your incredible care for Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_02
TEXT: I’m sure when Volcanion sees the kindness and respect you show your Pokémon companions, it’ll recognize the goodness in your heart.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_03
TEXT: Your approach could make all the difference in our chances of encountering this elusive Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_00
TEXT: Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many might’ve thought impossible—you’ve gained Volcanion’s trust!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_01
TEXT: Try to spend some quality time with this Mythical Pokémon and grow the special bond that only comes from mutual understanding and respect.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_02
TEXT: Our understanding of Pokémon has really grown thanks to this journey. The connection between Trainers and Pokémon is truly the ultimate research tool!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_03
TEXT: Your experience with Volcanion is going to inspire Trainers everywhere, %PLAYERNAME%. I couldn’t be more proud of you!
