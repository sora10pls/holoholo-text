RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_02
TEXT: I've gathered reports from multiple witnesses of Pokémon that sound a lot like Zacian and Zamazenta.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_03
TEXT: These mighty Warrior Pokémon achieved legendary feats in their time. I'm excited to dig into this development further.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_00_04_branch
TEXT: Which one should we look into?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_00_sword
TEXT: Alright, now is the time to strike! Let me recall my notes on Zacian..

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_01_sword
TEXT: Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_02_sword
TEXT: Very impressive. I wonder if Zacian could teach my Meltan how to do that? It does absorb metal as well...

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_01_03_sword
TEXT: Ah! I'm jumping ahead of myself. Let's work on finding Zacian first. If we split up our search, we can cut our time in half. Meet back here in a bit!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_00_sword
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! No Zacian sightings for me, though I did find some new information on it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_01_sword
TEXT: This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it's Zamazenta's elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals. What do you think, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_02_sword
TEXT: Haha, you're right! Who's to say they can't be both? I like your sharp thinking.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_02_03_sword
TEXT: Let's keep looking. Chaaaaarge!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_00_sword
TEXT: Magnificent, you've found Zacian! Goodness, it truly "steels" the show.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_01_sword
TEXT: Can you believe it has another impressive form as well? When armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, Zacian transforms into its Crowned Sword Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_02_sword
TEXT: It needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_03_03_sword
TEXT: I'm sure such incredible power will give you quite the edge in a Max Battle soon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_00_sword
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I've been thinking about Zacian and its Crowned Sword Form.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_sword
TEXT: Able to cut down anything with a single strike, it became known as the Fairy King's Sword. It inspired awe in friend and foe alike.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_02_sword
TEXT: I'd be keen to observe it in a Max Battle, if you're up for it.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_03_sword
TEXT: That's the spirit! Ready when you are!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_00_sword
TEXT: Just phenomenal! What an honor to observe such a riveting Max Battle with your Crowned Sword Zacian.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_01_sword
TEXT: Your Zacian empowered me as well! RARGH!! ... Maybe I'll just leave the battle cries to the Pokemon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_02_sword
TEXT: Whatever challenges may come your way in the future, I know you and Zacian can take on anything together.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_03_sword
TEXT: Until next time, let's GO!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_00
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! What an exciting day we have ahead of us!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_01
TEXT: There's something heartwarming about watching Trainers connect, catching new Pokémon and making new friends.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_02
TEXT: I've noticed something curious though - a strange fog is rolling in. While I'm not exactly sure what this phenomenon means yet, it certainly warrants investigation.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_03
TEXT: Have fun exploring and we'll reconvene later to discuss my findings.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I've been monitoring that mysterious fog, and while there are no new updates, I have discovered something else equally fascinating during my research!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_01
TEXT: The Pokémon seem to be gathering around four distinct habitats, each with its own unique characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_02
TEXT: I've observed Wooloo doting Noble Fields, red and blue Basculin near Sunken Treasure, and even a Heracross at the nearby Carnival Grounds.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_03
TEXT: There's also a fourth habitat that I haven't had the chance to explore yet!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_04
TEXT: Which habitat will your research take you to first? The choice is yours, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_00
TEXT: Impressive work on that first habitat! Point us toward our next discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_01
TEXT: Another habitat successfully investigated! Where to next, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_02
TEXT: Remarkable work, %PLAYERNAME%! Only one more habitat remains unexplored.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_00
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! After analyzing the mysterious fog, I've found evidence suggesting the presence of the mythical steam Pokemon, Volcanion.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_01
TEXT: I was digging into my notes right before you arrived. Did you know that Volcanion harnesses water to create steam?

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_02
TEXT: To learn more about this elusive Pokémon, I need you to study other Water-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_03
TEXT: Pay particular attention if they can also regulate their internal water reservoirs and control temperature. Each observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_00
TEXT: Incredible progress with your Water-type research! Now, to continue our understanding of Volcanion, we need to focus on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_01
TEXT: Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon that is both Fire and Water type, understanding how it manages these opposing elements is crucial to our research.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_02
TEXT: I'd like you to observe Fire-type Pokémon in their natural habitats - pay close attention to what mechanisms they use to prevent overheating.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_03
TEXT: These observations will help us understand Volcanion's remarkable dual typing! Your fieldwork continues to be essential to our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_00
TEXT: Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to your research on both Water and Fire-type Pokémon, we now have a much clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_01
TEXT: Our next challenge is perhaps the most important yet - we need to show Volcanion that you're a trustworthy trainer! Let's focus on demonstrating your exceptional care for Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_02
TEXT: When Volcanion witnesses the kindness and respect you show to your Pokémon companions, it will surely recognize the goodness in your heart.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_03
TEXT: Your gentle approach could make all the difference in our ability to encounter this elusive Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_00
TEXT: Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many thought impossible - you've successfully gained Volcanion's trust!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_01
TEXT: Now, I encourage you to spend quality time with this mythical Pokémon. Form that special bond that only comes from understanding and respecting each other.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_02
TEXT: This journey has expanded our understanding of Pokémon. It is true that the connection between Trainers and Pokémon is our ultimate research tool!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_03
TEXT: Your experience with Volcanion will inspire Trainers everywhere. I couldn't be prouder of your accomplishment, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_00
TEXT: Ahoy %PLAYERNAME%! Prepare yourself to dive into the depths of the Sunken Treasure habitat. I'm sure you already feel the thrill of adventure washing over you.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_01
TEXT: The true treasures in these waters aren't gold doubloons or precious gems, but the remarkable Pokémon that call this habitat home.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_02
TEXT: Those twinkling lights in the distance may be passing glow of an Inkay, or the shining tail fins of a Finneon gliding by.

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_03

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_00
TEXT: Aha, %PLAYERNAME%! Your timing couldn’t be better! Tell me—have you noticed anything unusual about your shadow lately?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_01
TEXT: Several Trainers across the region claim to have seen something strange going on with their shadows.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_02
TEXT: I’m pretty sure the reports align with something I put down in my older research, but I have to find my notes before I can confirm my theory.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_03
TEXT: If you’re up for it, let’s go with a tried-and-true play: I’ll search my archives, and you can go out and investigate. Your field observations could prove invaluable!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_00

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_01

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_02

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_00
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. I see my appearance has caught you off guard. Rest assured, you did not startle me.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_01
TEXT: You’re looking for Professor Willow, correct? I saw him moments ago, though his behavior was somewhat...unusual. It looked as though he was tracking something through the shadows, off in that direction.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_02
TEXT: These shadowy anomalies you’ve likely heard about—I’ve been studying them myself, though my observations have yet to yield definitive conclusions.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_03
TEXT: Perhaps your own investigation will prove more fruitful. But be cautious, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_00
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You after Professor Willow, too?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_00

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_01
TEXT: I’ve cross-referenced our recent field data against my old notes, and I managed to identify the source of these mysterious occurrences!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_02
TEXT: A powerful presence is out there, observing Trainers and their Pokémon. Based on the data, it should be nearby, too.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_03
TEXT: We’re looking at a massive research opportunity here—and you’re the perfect Trainer for the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_04
TEXT: Get out there and investigate the thing that’s causing all these odd shadows—but remember to be careful. We don’t know for sure what lies in the darkness!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_00
TEXT: Exceptional work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_01
TEXT: The strange shadows were actually the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow, hiding in plain sight! Well, plain-ish.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_02
TEXT: Following its trail through the darkness got us closer than we realized, but it took someone with your special connection to Pokémon to finally draw it into the light.
