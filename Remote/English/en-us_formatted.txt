RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_11
TEXT: What’s more, I feel a sort of...mysterious power emanating from the bottle. The patterns on it seem reminiscent of Hoopa, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_12
TEXT: It’s all got me tremendously excited! We’ve been trying to learn more about Hoopa for a while now, and I have a feeling this may be the final piece of the puzzle.

TEXT: Naturally, I’ll need your help to put it all together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_14

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_8

Until an offering is made again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_9
TEXT: Poetry isn’t exactly my forte, but it’s got a pleasant rhyme structure, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy analyzing the poem and the bottle it came with—and I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_2
TEXT: The poem seems to be providing hints as to how to change Hoopa’s form—and I believe this bottle is somehow involved in that process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_3
TEXT: With that said, the bottle’s power appears to be dormant. But with more research, I’m confident we can find a way to harness it and change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_4
TEXT: After all we’ve overcome to get this far, I have no doubt the two of us can crack this together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_5
TEXT: Will you help me conduct some more research so we can witness Hoopa’s other form?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_0
TEXT: Eureka! %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve just had a massive breakthrough.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_1
TEXT: Remember this part of the poem? 
“Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_2
TEXT: I believe the poem is telling us to use Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_3
TEXT: You can get Stardust by catching Pokémon and battling in raids, but you can earn Hoopa Candy only by adventuring with Hoopa as your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_4
TEXT: Luckily, I’ve managed to convert the bottle’s power into Hoopa Candy. Once you’ve gathered everything you need, you’ll be able to change your Hoopa Confined into Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_5
TEXT: There’s another bit of the poem that I think is relevant here, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_6
TEXT: “And in this form it shall remain 
Until an offering is made again.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_7
TEXT: It sounds like you’ll also need Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa Unbound back into Hoopa Confined—but something tells me you won’t need quite as much.
