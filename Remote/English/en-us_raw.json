"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_00", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! After analyzing the mysterious fog, I've found evidence suggesting the presence of the mythical steam Pokemon, Volcanion.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_01", "I was digging into my notes right before you arrived. Did you know that Volcanion harnesses water to create steam?",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_02", "To learn more about this elusive Pokémon, I need you to study other Water-type Pokémon.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_03", "Pay particular attention if they can also regulate their internal water reservoirs and control temperature. Each observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_00", "Incredible progress with your Water-type research! Now, to continue our understanding of Volcanion, we need to focus on Fire-type Pokémon.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_01", "Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon that is both Fire and Water type, understanding how it manages these opposing elements is crucial to our research.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_02", "I'd like you to observe Fire-type Pokémon in their natural habitats - pay close attention to what mechanisms they use to prevent overheating.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_03", "These observations will help us understand Volcanion's remarkable dual typing! Your fieldwork continues to be essential to our research, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_00", "Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to your research on both Water and Fire-type Pokémon, we now have a much clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_01", "Our next challenge is perhaps the most important yet - we need to show Volcanion that you're a trustworthy trainer! Let's focus on demonstrating your exceptional care for Pokémon.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_02", "When Volcanion witnesses the kindness and respect you show to your Pokémon companions, it will surely recognize the goodness in your heart.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_03", "Your gentle approach could make all the difference in our ability to encounter this elusive Pokémon!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_00", "Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many thought impossible - you've successfully gained Volcanion's trust!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_01", "Now, I encourage you to spend quality time with this mythical Pokémon. Form that special bond that only comes from understanding and respecting each other.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_02", "This journey has expanded our understanding of Pokémon. It is true that the connection between Trainers and Pokémon is our ultimate research tool!",
