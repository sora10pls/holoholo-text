"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_01", "Which, of course, presents the perfect opportunity for research! We can gather valuable data if we track hourly changes in Pokémon habitats.",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_01_02", "And those observations could help us glean crucial insights into Volcanion’s habitat preferences and behaviors.",

"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_01", "Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon to be both Fire- and Water-type, it’s critical that we understand how it behaves.",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_02", "Let’s observe Fire types in their natural habitats. And try to pay close attention to the mechanisms they use to keep from overheating.",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_03_03", "The conclusions we draw will help us understand Volcanion. Remember, your fieldwork is essential, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_00", "Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Your survey of Water and Fire types has given us a clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_01", "Now, our next challenge might be the most important yet. We’ve got to show Volcanion that you’re a Trainer who can be trusted. Let’s focus on demonstrating your incredible care for Pokémon!",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_02", "I’m sure when Volcanion sees the kindness and respect you show your Pokémon companions, it’ll recognize the goodness in your heart.",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_04_03", "Your approach could make all the difference in our chances of encountering this elusive Pokémon!",
"go_fest_2025_global_sr_volcanion_05_00", "Phenomenal job as always, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many might’ve thought impossible—you’ve gained Volcanion’s trust!",
