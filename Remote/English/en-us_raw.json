"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_01_sword", "According to my research, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, inspiring awe in friend and foe alike.",

"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_04_03_sword", "That’s the spirit! Ready when you are!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_00_shield", "Phenomenal work! What an honor to observe your Crowned Shield Zamazenta in such a riveting Max Battle.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_00_sword", "Just phenomenal! What an honor to witness your Crowned Sword Zacian in such a riveting Max Battle.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_city_05_01_shield", "I’ve never seen such an incredible display of defensive skill. You two can certainly hold your own against Dynamax Pokémon.",

"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_01", "Isn’t there something heartwarming about watching Trainers catch new Pokémon and make new friends?",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_02", "But I’ve noticed something curious—a strange fog is rolling in. While I’m not sure what this phenomenon means yet, it certainly warrants investigation.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_00_03", "So let’s get to it! Have fun exploring, and we’ll reconvene later to discuss our findings.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_00", "Welcome back! I’ve been monitoring that mysterious fog. There are no updates, but I discovered something quite fascinating!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_01", "Pokémon seem to be gathering around four distinct habitats, each with its own unique characteristics.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_02", "I've observed Wooloo frolicking in local fields, Basculin with red and blue stripes swimming around an underwater trove, and even a Heracross running around a nearby carnival.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_03", "There’s also a fourth habitat that I haven’t had the chance to explore yet!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_01_04", "Where will your research take you first? The choice is yours, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_00", "Impressive work on that first habitat! Point us toward our next discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_01", "Another habitat successfully investigated! Where to next, %PLAYERNAME%?",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_02_02", "Remarkable work, %PLAYERNAME%! Only one more habitat left to explore.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_00", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! After analyzing the mysterious fog, I’ve found evidence suggesting a mythic presence—the Steam Pokémon, Volcanion.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_01", "I was going over my notes right before you arrived. Did you know that Volcanion harnesses water to create steam?",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_02", "To learn more about this elusive Pokémon, I’d like you to dive into studying other Water types.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_03_03", "See what you can learn about their internal water reservoirs or temperature regulation. Each observation brings us one step closer to Volcanion!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_00", "Incredible progress with your soggy survey! Now let’s turn our attention to Fire-type Pokémon.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_01", "Since Volcanion is currently the only known Pokémon that is both Fire- and Water-type, understanding how it manages these opposing elements is crucial.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_02", "I’d like you to turn up the heat on observing Fire types in their natural habitats. Pay close attention to what mechanisms they use to prevent overheating.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_04_03", "This will help us to better understand Volcanion’s remarkable dual typing. Your fieldwork continues to be essential, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_00", "Amazing discoveries, %PLAYERNAME%! Your research on both Water and Fire types gives us a clearer understanding of how Volcanion might behave in the wild.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_01", "Our next challenge is perhaps the most important yet— we need to show Volcanion that you’re a trustworthy Trainer. Let’s focus on demonstrating your exceptional care for Pokémon!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_02", "When Volcanion witnesses the kindness and respect you show to your Pokémon companions, it will surely recognize the goodness in your heart.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_05_03", "Your gentle approach could make all the difference in our ability to encounter this elusive Pokémon!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_00", "Phenomenal job as always! Your patience, dedication, and kind heart have accomplished what many thought impossible—you’ve gained Volcanion’s trust!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_01", "I encourage you to spend quality time with this Mythical Pokémon. Grow that special bond that only comes from understanding and respecting each other.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_02", "This journey has expanded our understanding of Pokémon. The connection between Trainers and Pokémon is truly our ultimate research tool!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sr_park_06_03", "Your experience with Volcanion will inspire Trainers everywhere. I couldn’t be prouder, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_00", "Ahoy, %PLAYERNAME%! Prepare yourself to dive into the depths of this watery habitat. I’m sure you already feel the thrill of adventure washing over you.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_01", "The true treasures in these waters aren’t gold doubloons or precious gems, but the remarkable Pokémon that call this place home.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_02", "Those twinkling lights in the distance may be the passing glow of an Inkay, or the shining tail fins of a Finneon.",
"go_fest_2025_irl_sunkern_treasure_00_03", "Set forth to explore this habitat with the heart of an adventurer! May fortune find you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
