RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#1
TEXT: Why do you insist on wasting my time?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#10
TEXT: You lack the gravitas to be in the presence of Team GO Rocket. I’ll finish this quickly.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#2
TEXT: Well, if you insist on battling, as a Trainer, I must accept. However, you will pay for inconveniencing me.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#3
TEXT: You have such an air of arrogance about you. Allow me to dispel it for you.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#4
TEXT: Your insolence disgusts me. I’ll make sure your confidence is utterly shattered following this battle.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#5
TEXT: Your sense of self-importance sickens me. Are you prepared to be wholly humiliated?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#6
TEXT: Your arrogance will be your downfall, and I shall be the one to set that in motion.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#7
TEXT: Loss is not a concept I’m acquainted with. I don’t expect that will change after this battle.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#8
TEXT: A person of your stature shouldn’t be this confident. Fret not—I’ll do you the honor of teaching you this lesson.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#9
TEXT: Usually I wouldn’t consider debasing myself by battling a commoner...but I’ll make an exception to humiliate you.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_defeat#1
TEXT: How...how can this be? I...I never lose!

RESOURCE ID: arlo_defeat#2
TEXT: How dare you...humiliate me like this?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_defeat#3
TEXT: I haven’t felt this much humiliation since I lost my battle with Candela... You’ll pay for this.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_defeat#4
TEXT: The last person to humiliate me like this was Candela. You’ll all pay for this...

RESOURCE ID: arlo_defeat#5
TEXT: I...I don’t understand... I never lose...

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#1
TEXT: Oh? Are you here to challenge me? Don’t test me.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#10
TEXT: Pokémon are my tools, and winning is my birthright. Get in my way, and you’ll be crushed, vermin.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#2
TEXT: Are you the best that Candela and her little friends could find?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#3
TEXT: Tch... How dare riffraff such as yourself speak to me?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#4
TEXT: Only a fool would challenge me.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#5
TEXT: Team GO Rocket’s domination is inevitable. Submit and you may be spared.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#6
TEXT: Pokémon are our tools. We are entitled to power them up as we so choose. Commoners such as yourself would never understand.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#7
TEXT: My sole purpose in life is to win. I’ll vanquish whoever dares to get in my way.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#8
TEXT: Oh, do YOU think you can beat me? Someone of your standing? Hah!

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#9
TEXT: What a fool you are to even think of battling me.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_victory#1
TEXT: Don’t be too disappointed. It was always going to end like this.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_victory#2
TEXT: I never lose. Now get out of my sight.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_victory#3
TEXT: If this is the best Candela and her little friends can offer, Team GO Rocket has nothing to worry about.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_victory#4
TEXT: If the rest of the Trainers of this world are like you, then Team GO Rocket’s success is assured.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_victory#5
TEXT: It was foolish of you to think you could beat me. It’s because of my brilliance that we have Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! As great as it is to see you, I have troubling news to share.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been receiving reports of light and shadow behaving oddly in major cities around the globe, and now it looks like it’s happening everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_2
TEXT: It’s a strange phenomenon, and I’m worried about the safety of our world and all the Pokémon in it.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_3
TEXT: And as one of the most skilled and dedicated Trainers I know, I’ll need your help to shine some light on this mystery.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_4
TEXT: This is a crucial mission, %PLAYERNAME%. Can I count on you?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Given all the bizarre occurrences taking place worldwide, we need to prioritize ensuring the safety and well-being of the Pokémon in our area!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_1
TEXT: And the best way for us to do that is for you to catch and befriend as many of them as you can!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_2
TEXT: That way you can monitor their behavior firsthand and report any unusual findings.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_3
TEXT: How about it? Ready to get out there and catch some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for tending to all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m still getting reports of shadows throughout the world behaving unusually, so it looks like our work has just begun.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_1
TEXT: I’d like you to survey the area and pay particular attention to any shadows you come across.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_2
TEXT: And while you’re out there, why not take the opportunity to hatch some Eggs?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_3
TEXT: Exploring is a great way to incubate Eggs and discover new Pokémon that could potentially aid our cause.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Our investigation has yielded exciting results!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_1
TEXT: Given all our observations, the only logical conclusion is that we have Marshadow on our hands!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_2
TEXT: Marshadow is a unique Pokémon with the ability to conceal itself within any shadow.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_3
TEXT: It’s likely feeling very cautious right now. We need to consider our next steps carefully and approach from a place of understanding.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_4
TEXT: But I’m confident that with your patience and skills as a Trainer, you’ll be able to coax it out of the shadows!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_1
TEXT: Your efforts to create a comfortable environment for Marshadow are paying off.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_2
TEXT: Keep it up and I have a feeling we’ll see it out in the open before long. Wouldn’t that be an incredible sight?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_3
TEXT: Let’s continue to foster a welcoming atmosphere. With any luck, we’ll make a breakthrough!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_0
TEXT: Congratulations, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve done it!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_1
TEXT: We’ve successfully unraveled the mystery of the shadows, and it’s all thanks to your tireless efforts.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_2
TEXT: On top of that, we’ve made a brand-new friend! I’m sure that together, we’ll make even more incredible discoveries that continue strengthening the bond between humans and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_3
TEXT: I can hardly wait to see what exciting challenges await us next!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_0
TEXT: Your arrival is well timed, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_1
TEXT: Necrozma is emerging from the Ultra Wormhole that marks the sky, and its hunger for light threatens to upset the delicate balance of your world.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_2
TEXT: I find myself in need of your skills and courage.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_3
TEXT: We must confront this disturbance to ensure that we are able to protect both humans and Pokémon alike.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, Necrozma has entered your world. Remain vigilant as we navigate these perilous circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_1
TEXT: As you engage with this formidable Pokémon, anticipate its actions and adapt your tactics accordingly.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_2
TEXT: Rely on the strength of your bond with your Pokémon. Trust in their abilities and the power of your shared resolve.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_3
TEXT: Your skill and determination as a Trainer will be greatly challenged, but I am confident in your success. Until we next meet.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_branching_text
TEXT: I have narrowed my focus, %PLAYERNAME%. I suspect we may learn much from certain Pokémon my radar has detected in the area. Which do you prefer to investigate?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_0
TEXT: A wise decision. Studying Crabrawler will help ensure our readiness for the impending confrontation with Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_1
TEXT: Crabrawler is a Fighting-type Pokémon known for having pincers suited to both offense and defense.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_2
TEXT: Observing these pincers may prove valuable in our forthcoming encounter with Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_3
TEXT: By studying Crabrawler’s techniques, we can gain insight into how to approach our own strategy.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_0
TEXT: A wise decision, %PLAYERNAME%. Studying Ducklett will help ensure our readiness for the impending confrontation with Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_1
TEXT: Ducklett is a Water- and Flying-type Pokémon that splashes water with its feathers to allow it to escape from harm’s way.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_2
TEXT: By studying Ducklett’s tactics, we can gain insight into how to approach our own strategy.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_3
TEXT: Your findings will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of how to best confront the challenges that lie ahead.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_0
TEXT: A wise decision. Studying Emolga will help ensure our readiness for the impending confrontation with Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_1
TEXT: Emolga is an Electric- and Flying-type Pokémon known for scattering electricity as it soars through the air.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_2
TEXT: This distinctive behavior causes other Pokémon to maintain a cautious distance.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_3
TEXT: By studying Emolga’s tactics, we can gain insight into how to approach our own strategy.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_0
TEXT: Your presence brings me great relief, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_1
TEXT: The threat that Necrozma’s hunger for light poses cannot be overstated.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_2
TEXT: Observe the cracks in the sky. Similar phenomena have been reported around the globe.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_3
TEXT: Necrozma emerges even now. Your world looks to us for a solution.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_4
TEXT: I believe that you, %PLAYERNAME%, are the only one with the skills and compassion necessary to confront Necrozma and catch it.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_5
TEXT: Let us combine our efforts to face this challenge. Together, I am certain we will triumph over even the darkest of threats.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_0
TEXT: Your return brings me joy, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish to illuminate what I know about Necrozma’s ability to fuse.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_1
TEXT: By fusing with Solgaleo or Lunala, it is able to change form and become either Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_2
TEXT: We still have much to learn about this ability. I am eager to witness its results.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_3
TEXT: Your journey with Necrozma is far from over. You have my thanks for rising to the challenges of better understanding this fascinating Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_branching_text
TEXT: I commend your remarkable feat. With Necrozma under your guidance, I encourage you to explore the mysterious phenomenon known as fusion. I see two paths forward—one of light, and one of shadows.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_1_0
TEXT: I repeat my earlier sentiment of admiration—I knew my faith in you was well placed. By securing Necrozma, you have protected both the humans and Pokémon of your world.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_1_1
TEXT: As you are aware, Ultra Wormholes are gateways through which Ultra Beasts can enter your world.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_1_2
TEXT: I have also detected the presence of an immense power—the Legendary Pokémon Lunala.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: While you busied yourself gathering intel, I was studying up on Land Forme Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_05

TEXT: Wonderful Pokémon research as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: Another fact! Did you know Shaymin is able to transform ruined lands by dissolving toxins in the air? Amazing!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: This Legendary Pokémon is missing parts from its body. That may be why it has to stabilize by freezing itself!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Its genes are similar to two other Legendary Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom—and my readings indicate it’s seeking them out as we speak.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: Let’s keep our eyes on the situation, %PLAYERNAME%. Things could spiral out of control if these powerful Pokémon meet.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: So, Kyurem is able to fuse with either the Vast White Pokémon, Reshiram, or the Deep Black Pokémon, Zekrom.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: In doing so, it absorbs the other Pokémon to become White Kyurem or Black Kyurem, respectively.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: That said, we don’t know which of the two Kyurem will go for, and we can only focus on one at a time.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which means that whether we track down Reshiram or Zekrom first, we’re giving Kyurem a chance to find the other.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_00
TEXT: Zekrom’s tail contains a giant electrical generator. When the interior part of the tail spins like a motor, it creates lightning it can use to blast its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_01
TEXT: And in the past, when people lost sight of the righteousness in their hearts, Zekrom would raze their kingdoms with bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: I do love a good mystery! Anyhow, all three of these powerful Pokémon seem to have a deep connection with Unova.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: Perhaps we can get a better understanding of them by studying other Pokémon first discovered in the region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Oshawott as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_02
TEXT: They keep honing their skills as they evolve. They seem like a dedicated bunch!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: Rumor has it that Kyurem dwells in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: Unova is an extraordinary place! It has bustling modern metropolises, but there are also tranquil forests whose inhabitants live in harmony with nature.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: And since we’re going to unravel a Unova mystery, it’s only fitting that we get help from Pokémon first discovered there.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which of these first partner Pokémon would you like to join you on this adventure?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_00
TEXT: Here’s a fun fact about Oshawott: the shell it has is called a “scalchop.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_01
TEXT: They use their scalchop not only as a blade in battle, but also as a tool to break open hard Berries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_02
TEXT: They’ll even sharpen them on riverbed stones, something apparently learned by mimicking humans using whetstones.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_03
TEXT: In other words, Oshawott need to take good care of their scalchops in order to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_04
TEXT: I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_00
TEXT: Snivy prefers to avoid groups, so it’s a great match for Trainers who tend to be more independent.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_01
TEXT: The leaf on its tail generates energy when exposed to sunlight. When it’s not feeling well, the tail will start to droop.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_02
TEXT: On the other hand—or vine—Snivy that get enough light become swift and dexterous!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_03
TEXT: In other words, Snivy need alone time and ample sunlight to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_01
TEXT: They use their excellent sense of smell to find food, and then they cook it up nice and crispy before they eat it!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_02
TEXT: It can launch fireballs from its nose, but don’t expect more than pitch-black smoke if it gets sick.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_03
TEXT: In any case, Tepig need snacks aplenty to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. So, given what I can glean from my research, Kyurem seems to be looking for something.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: From what I’ve read, it’s waiting for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with either truth or ideals.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: Heady stuff, eh? While you’re certainly a hero in my book, I don’t know what to do with the rest of it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: For now, the best we can do is try and keep Kyurem busy. Battle it with everything you’ve got, and I’m sure you’ll succeed!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: And as I suspected, they’re not just any sound wave, they’re the unique melodies of the Mythical Pokémon Meloetta!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: Meloetta uses song to influence the emotions of those who hear it. And on that note, I’d like you to try and spot any unusual behavior in the local Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: It’s not every day we get to study a Mythical Pokémon, so let’s make the most of this opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_00
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! We may not have found Meloetta yet, but I can definitely still hear it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: If it isn’t our intrepid enter-Trainer! Say, did you know that Meloetta’s melodies have inspired many famous songs?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: It’s just fascinating—Meloetta shows us how music helps us to forge special bonds with one another.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: It’s not unlike your amazing ability to connect with other people and Pokémon. Every new Pokémon you catch or Trainer you meet is a new potential friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_00_03

TEXT: Are you already familiar with the Red and Blue Orbs?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_02
TEXT: Professor Willow informed me they originate from a region called “Hoenn.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_03
TEXT: The Orbs have some influence over Primal Reversion. This is the transformation Kyogre and Groudon undergo when they absorb an abundance of natural energy.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_05

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_06

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_07
TEXT: Ah. I see your chosen Pokémon in that direction. Let us venture after it, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_00
TEXT: It is always a delight to watch you in action, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_01
TEXT: This chase has led us past a diverse array of Pokémon. It could signal that there is something of interest nearby, such as one of the Orbs.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_02
TEXT: It is also possible that Pokémon are attracted to—not merely attuned to—natural energy. Perhaps we are near one that has undergone Primal Reversion...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_03
TEXT: But we need not fear. I am confident you and your Pokémon can fend off Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. In the meantime, let us review what we know of them.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_04
TEXT: According to Professor Willow, Groudon has long been described in mythology as the Pokémon that raised lands and expanded continents.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_05
TEXT: Legends tell of its many clashes against Kyogre, as each sought to gain the power of nature. Could Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon be fighting once again? That would explain the strange weather.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_06
TEXT: And speaking of strange, look there—a scarlet glint, coming from that cave. Hm? You cannot see it? Worry not. I shall investigate.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_07
TEXT: In the meantime, I hear a telltale cry growing nearer. Could it be Primal Groudon?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Thank you for keeping Primal Groudon at bay, %PLAYERNAME%. Here is my contribution—the Red Orb.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: The cave I found it in was most impressive. The Red Orb shone with a brilliant crimson light atop something like an altar. Perhaps it was an object of worship in a time long past.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: Only the Blue Orb remains. It is associated with Kyogre, if I am not mistaken.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: I have read that Kyogre is able to create massive rain clouds that cover the entire sky and bring about torrential downpours. It has appeared in mythology as the creator of the sea.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: The sea... The way sunlight glitters upon the waters of this world is enchanting. The sights where I am from are utterly unalike—though I would still enjoy bringing you to visit someday, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_05

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_00
TEXT: Resplendent work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_01
TEXT: While you were away, I followed the path of the rain’s runoff. It led me to another mysterious cavern, this time filled with an azure light. The Blue Orb was atop a shining altar. I wish we could have beheld it together.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_02
TEXT: Now, with both Orbs in our possession, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon will cease their rampage.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_03
TEXT: Climatic conditions should soon stabilize, and natural forces will once again find harmony.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_04
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance today. I would not have been able to recover the Orbs without the protection provided by you and your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_05
TEXT: Before we return to Professor Willow, I have one more favor to ask of you.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_06
TEXT: All our talk of Kyogre and Groudon’s might has sparked my curiosity.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_07
TEXT: Now that we can safely observe Primal Reversion with the Orbs in our possession, could you give me a demonstration of the phenomenon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! There you are. The weather’s finally stopped going topsy-turvy! I take that to mean you and Rhi were successful in finding the Red and Blue Orbs.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_01
TEXT: You two are amazing. Normally, it’d take no less than Rayquaza descending to the ground to settle one of Kyogre and Groudon’s “arguments”!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_02
TEXT: Maybe you got the jump on it. Rayquaza would have to be mighty speedy to get ahead of you two!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_03
TEXT: Oh, that reminds me. While you and Rhi were off saving the day, I had some time to think about what could’ve caused the surge of natural energy to begin with. My top theory so far is—

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_06

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_branch_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_branch_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_global_sr_dialog_branch_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Boy, am I glad to see you out here.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: We’ve got something of a unique situation on our hands.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: With nature’s forces out of balance, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have awakened, and they’re wreaking havoc in the surrounding area.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: It’s no exaggeration to say the entire world is in peril. The team leaders and Rhi are busy tackling the situation on another front, so some...unlikely allies have offered their support.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_04
TEXT: I know what I’m about to say is mind-boggling, but Team GO Rocket has offered to work with us to keep Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon in check.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_05
TEXT: I never thought I’d see the day. I guess the blustering weather has made even Team GO Rocket’s disposition turn sunny!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_06
TEXT: Will you meet with them, %PLAYERNAME%? Not only do I have every confidence in your ability to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon, but I know you’ll be able to stop Team GO Rocket if they try any underhanded tricks.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_07
TEXT: Now hurry—there’s no time to lose!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_00
TEXT: Hmph.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_01
TEXT: I can’t believe I’m being forced to work with one of Candela’s friends. Unbelievable. As if I need help.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_02
TEXT: But even I know better than to disobey Giovanni, so there’s no worming my way out of this one.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_03
TEXT: Just be grateful I’m giving you my time. For the record, I’m more than capable of handling this alone.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_04
TEXT: In fact, I’ve already come up with a plan to restrain Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. All that’s left for you to do is follow my orders.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_05
TEXT: First, we’re going to inspect the locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared. I’m putting you in charge of recording any anomalies you see in the area.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_06
TEXT: Well? You heard me, did you not? Time to go.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_00
TEXT: FINALLY. You’ve got some nerve, showing up late. I’ve been waiting an entire 45 seconds!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_01
TEXT: Thought you’d be better at this teamwork business, considering how much time you spend yakking with Professor Willow and that kid with the funky goggles.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_02
TEXT: Don’t waste our time apologizing. And don’t bother introducing yourself. We’ve met enough times to skip the pleasantries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_03
TEXT: Let’s get down to business. Our bosses want us to check out a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_04
TEXT: Huh? What do you mean, Professor Willow’s not your boss? Whatever. You got the gist.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_05
TEXT: Time to get moving. Less talking, more walking!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_00
TEXT: Well, well! Isn’t this a lovely surprise? We’re on the same side for once!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_01
TEXT: Don’t look so concerned. There’s nothing in it for me if the world sinks, shakes, or whatever it is we’re supposed to be worried about.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_02
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, darling, you can trust me.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_03
TEXT: Not that you have many options right now—especially with your esteemed team leaders and the little begoggled one otherwise occupied.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_04
TEXT: Collaborating will be a new experience for me, too. So let’s find the silver lining of this debacle and learn from one another, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_05
TEXT: First, you and your Pokémon will accompany me to a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_06
TEXT: Come along. Let’s see what you’re made of.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_00
TEXT: I’ll acknowledge you have some skill with a camera.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_01
TEXT: *sigh* Thank you, whatever your name was. This’ll do.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_02
TEXT: Now I have enough information to move on with my investigation of Primal Reversion.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_03
TEXT: You look confused. Did that professor of yours never teach you about Primal Reversion?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_04
TEXT: I bet you’re thinking that if Candela were here, she could explain it. Unfortunately for you, I’m your leader for today.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_05
TEXT: Hmph... Fine. I’ll humor you with an explanation, if only to prove that I know more than both Candela and your professor about the subject.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_06
TEXT: Primal Reversion is a phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It’s similar to Mega Evolution, and it grants them incredible power and strength. You follow?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_07
TEXT: Did you just...thank me? Er. Gratitude won’t get you anywhere, you know.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_08
TEXT: I’ll admit I’m not hating this alliance as much as I’d expected... But don’t push your luck.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_00
TEXT: Huh. These are decent snapshots.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_01
TEXT: What do I need ’em for? Hah! That’s the smartest question you’ve asked all day.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_02
TEXT: These’ll help us understand Primal Reversion—the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon return to their primal forms. I’ve heard Arlo say it’s kind of like Mega Evolution, but powered by nature’s energy.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_03
TEXT: Now you can go give Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon the smackdown.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_04
TEXT: What’s that? Of course I’m coming with you. We’re a team today.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_05
TEXT: “Can’t leave a partner out to dry.” That’s what we used to say back on the ranch.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_06
TEXT: Didn’t know I had a ranch? Guess you wouldn’t. Those days are long gone, anyhow.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_07
TEXT: OK, enough chitchat. You and your Pokémon are gonna lead the way, “partner.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_08
TEXT: You’ve kept up so far. Now show me you’ve got what it takes!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_00
TEXT: These snapshots could’ve been dreadful, but they’re actually decent! Color me mildly impressed.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_01
TEXT: They’d be better without your Pokémon in the way. All the same, these will help us better understand Primal Reversion.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_02
TEXT: Primal Reversion? You know, the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It’s quite similar to Mega Evolution, but powered by a different source.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_03
TEXT: There, you see? Take that tidbit as a token of my appreciation for your assistance. Perhaps working with others does have its merits.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_04
TEXT: For our next move, let’s see how helpful these observations are in facing the power of Primal Reversion directly.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_05
TEXT: I believe I hear a telltale cry coming from that direction. Take your Pokémon and challenge them for me, would you?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! The strange weather seems to have subsided a little. Your attempts to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are clearly paying off. Great work!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: I take it your partnership with Team GO Rocket is going well.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: It goes to show we can always find new friends, even in precarious times. But before I let you get back to it... Well. Keep your guard up.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: I don’t feel good taking Team GO Rocket’s newfound helpfulness with such a large spoonful of skepticism, but I can’t forget their past deeds so easily.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: Until they give us cause for concern, though, I’m thankful for their help.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_05
TEXT: But remember that even though you’ve gathered some research material—great snapshots, by the way—we haven’t managed to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon for good.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_06
TEXT: I’m off to check if Rhi and the team leaders have made any progress toward locating the Red and Blue Orbs. Keep at it, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_00
TEXT: Acceptable work. You’ve actually managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_01
TEXT: And what do you have there? Let me see it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_02
TEXT: This looks similar to Mega Energy. Could it be...nature’s energy distilled?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_03
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_04
TEXT: Interesting. Fascinating, even. Now I have what I need. With this new power source, Team GO Rocket—no, I, Arlo—will be able to control the very shape of the earth.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_05
TEXT: But even without that power, there’s one thing I can rid myself of right now.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_06
TEXT: You. Farewell, friend of Candela. This alliance is over.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_00
TEXT: You’ve calmed Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon a few times now.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_01
TEXT: Not bad! I’d promote you if you were on my team. I know good work when I see it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_02
TEXT: In fact, I’m getting the hang of it by watching you.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_03
TEXT: Which means Team GO Rocket’s got no more use for you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_04
TEXT: So long, “partner”!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_05
TEXT: Don’t tell me you thought we were all best buds now? Pfft... Hahaha!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_06
TEXT: Nothing will shake my loyalty to Team GO Rocket. And don’t you forget it!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_00
TEXT: Truly impressive! You’ve managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon more than once now.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_01
TEXT: Watching you and your Pokémon in action has been a joy. I’ve learned ever so much.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_02
TEXT: In fact, I’ve learned enough that Team GO Rocket no longer needs you to be part of this operation!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_03
TEXT: Oh, but where are my manners? I must thank you for showing us exactly how to take down Kyogre and Groudon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_04
TEXT: Rest secure in the knowledge that you’ve contributed to the glory of Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_05
TEXT: You didn’t think this would last forever, did you? Oh, darling. Our alliance ends now.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_06
TEXT: Solitude is best, after all...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! What just happened? I saw the Team GO Rocket leaders running off in a huff! And your Pokémon look like they’ve been through the wringer!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_01
TEXT: *sigh* Let me guess. They tried to pull a fast one on us, didn’t they?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_02
TEXT: Not very smart of them to go toe-to-toe with you. I assume you taught them a lesson before they could complete their scheme. Tell me all about what happened.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_03
TEXT: ... ... ...
They made your Pokémon fight alone against Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon? And they were trying to harness the power of Primal Reversion for themselves?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_04
TEXT: Thank goodness you didn’t let that power fall into Team GO Rocket’s hands. If they’d gained the ability to reshape the world, who knows what they would’ve done?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_05
TEXT: Even with that disaster averted, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are no closer to calming down. We’ll have to rely on the team leaders and Rhi to find the Red and Blue Orbs so we can resolve the situation for good.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_06
TEXT: All the same, I don’t want to understate what you’ve done here, %PLAYERNAME%! Working with Team GO Rocket must have made for one uneasy alliance.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_07
TEXT: You have my thanks for a job well done. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you again soon.
(But...where did all this natural energy come from in the first place?)

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_arlo_defeat
TEXT: Tch... Don’t think for a second that you’ve seen the last of me.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_cliff_defeat
TEXT: Argh! The boss will be steamed when he hears about this...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_sierra_defeat

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_01
TEXT: You’re wired for this, %PLAYERNAME%! Now how about spending some quality time with your new friends?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_04
TEXT: I can corroborate your findings when you come back!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_02
TEXT: Here’s a hint: that Golem you caught will be very effective against an Electric type.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_03
TEXT: That’s grounds for celebration—you’ve got it! Electric-type Pokémon are weak against Ground types. You could say they zap the energy from our high-voltage friends.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_04
TEXT: Why don’t you roll out your Golem against some Electric types and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_05

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_01
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’s your training going?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_02
TEXT: I’ve been thinking. With all there is to learn, how does a person know when they’ve mastered something?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_03
TEXT: Just a little food for thought. Anyway, did you notice anything interesting out there?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_04
TEXT: I was struck by the high number of Electric- and Poison-type Pokémon buzzing and bubbling about.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_05
TEXT: In fact, speaking of measuring mastery—this is an excellent opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_branch

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_02
TEXT: They say you should avoid toxic people, but learning about Poison-type Pokémon is sure to be both fun AND useful!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_03
TEXT: A challenge you’re ready for, I have no doubt.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_00_04
TEXT: Let’s go see these Pokémon in action! Chaaaaarge!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_01_01
TEXT: You’re wired for this, %PLAYERNAME%! Now how about spending some quality time with your new friends?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_01_02
TEXT: Spark spends as much time as he can with his Pokémon. His instinct for bonding with Electric types is always spot on!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_01_03
TEXT: And remember—if you encounter mighty Pokémon out there, try using GO Safari Balls!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_02_01
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure your Electric-type pals were ec-static to spend time with you.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_02_02
TEXT: Did you get a chance to battle with them? Electric-type Pokémon are quite strong against Flying and Water types.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_02_03
TEXT: But do you know what they’re weak against? Why don’t you spend some more time with them and think on it.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_02_04
TEXT: I can corroborate your findings when you come back!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_03_01
TEXT: Great job! You’re fully plugged in when it comes to Electric-type Pokémon! Have you thought about their weaknesses?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_03_02
TEXT: Here’s a hint: that Golem you caught will be very effective against an Electric type.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_03_03
TEXT: That’s grounds for celebration—you’ve got it! Electric-type Pokémon are weak against Ground types. You could say they zap the energy from our high-voltage friends.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_03_04
TEXT: Why don’t you roll out your Golem against some Electric types and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_04_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_04_02
TEXT: Keep that spark alive, and it will continue to take you far.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_04_03
TEXT: With so many new Electric-type Pokémon by your side, I’m sure you’ll keep each other amped up for years to come.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_04_04
TEXT: I just have a few odds and ends left for you, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s finish strong!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_01
TEXT: You did it! I just knew you’d master both Poison- and Electric-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_02
TEXT: And you even caught a Dynamax Toxtricity—wow! Did you know that it has an electrical organ on its chest?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_03
TEXT: While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_04
TEXT: Hardcore! Just like you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_05
TEXT: Every rockstar needs their rest, though. You’ve earned it. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_intro_00_01
TEXT: Today is the beginning of a great adventure for you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_intro_00_02
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve noticed that there are oodles of Electric- and Poison-type Pokémon appearing in the area.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_intro_00_03
TEXT: It’s no easy task, but I believe you have what it takes to master both types—now’s your chance to put your training to the test!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_01
TEXT: All right! You’ve picked your poison! Er, Poison type, that is!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_02
TEXT: Some Trainers might shy away from confronting Poison-type Pokémon, but not you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_03
TEXT: And so, with that in mind, I’d like you to collect data on the Poison types in the area—a challenge I’m sure you’re up for!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_04
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_01
TEXT: Just look at all the Poison-type Pokémon you’ve caught. And what excellent snapshots!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_02
TEXT: I’m confident you could also master Pokémon photography. You should give it a shot!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_03
TEXT: Ahem. Now that you’ve caught some Poison-type Pokémon, it’s time to get to know them better.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_04
TEXT: Sharing some Berries is an effective way to build your friendship. Let me know how it goes!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_01
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Poison-type Pokémon look like great pals already.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_02
TEXT: Poison types are especially strong against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokémon, but do you know what their weakness is?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_03
TEXT: Here’s a hint: these Pokémon may “soil” a Poison-type Pokémon’s victory!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_04
TEXT: Heh. You work on that, and I’ll work on getting some new material. You’ve got this!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_01
TEXT: Venom...denim? No, that—ah! %PLAYERNAME%! I certainly wasn’t practicing my puns. Anyway, your Poison types are looking stronger than ever!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_02
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to face off against your team. That is, unless I knew what they were weak against. Any ideas?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_03
TEXT: Poison-type Pokémon are weak against both Psychic and Ground types, and your Golem has ground covered!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_04
TEXT: Why don’t you take it out for a spin and see for yourself? Let’s rock and roll!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_04_01
TEXT: Phenomenal work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_04_02
TEXT: Your skills are as potent as the Poison-type Pokémon you’re training!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_04_03
TEXT: With your guidance, they’ll be the most toxic Pokémon in the world. I mean, in a good way!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_04_04
TEXT: I just have a few more odds and ends I could use your help with. I know you can do it!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_01
TEXT: What impeccable timing, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_02
TEXT: I have something exciting to show you. This, my friend, is a GO Safari Ball.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_03
TEXT: Take note—they’re not like normal Poké Balls! They don’t last forever, so you need to use them before they disappear.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_04
TEXT: They should be useful if you come across any exceptionally strong Pokémon. Try them out and report back!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_01
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you find anything interesting?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_02
TEXT: And me? I’m glad you asked! I’ve spotted some unusually powerful Pokémon roaming about.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_03
TEXT: These mighty Pokémon are fully evolved, are larger and stronger than most other Pokémon of their species, and are more challenging to catch.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_04
TEXT: If you can find some of these mighty Pokémon, GO Safari Balls should be a big help.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_05

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but it’ll be just as fun—and challenging!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an amazing phenomenon—it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I need your help collecting data on this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: We’ll have another fun-filled day tomorrow. For now, I’m going to start looking into this situation. Perhaps it’s related to a powerful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_11
TEXT: Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_12
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: Furthermore, I’ve been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination. Have you been feeling it as well?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: I wonder whether it’s connected to the strange happenings that kicked off our research this weekend.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_9

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_10

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_11
TEXT: I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_12
TEXT: Others have also expressed distress over his absence—specifically, a fiery woman with short brown hair.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_13

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_14
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_2
TEXT: Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_3
TEXT: I lost myself in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_4
TEXT: I notice your fellows are gathering en masse.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_5
TEXT: Am I to understand this is typical for the Pokémon Trainers of your world?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_6
TEXT: So it is a festival. I see.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_7
TEXT: And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_8
TEXT: Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_9
TEXT: If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_1
TEXT: This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_10
TEXT: After you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_2
TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_3
TEXT: If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_4
TEXT: A shame. Moving on—you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_5
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_6
TEXT: An irradiant image. I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_7
TEXT: In a less eventful time, I would study Shaymin to see such a shine for myself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_8
TEXT: But I must temper my enthusiasm. An Ultra Wormhole could appear at any moment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_9
TEXT: We should continue our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Nihilego is no longer this world’s sole Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_2
TEXT: I have just observed UB-02 Beauty—Pheromosa, to some humans—emerge from a freshly formed Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_3
TEXT: Although it is a common organism in the world it calls home, it is a danger here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_4
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_5
TEXT: Luckily, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_6
TEXT: Just be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_7
TEXT: That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_8
TEXT: They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts. I hope they prove useful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_9
TEXT: Now, if you will attend to catching Pheromosa, I will focus on reconnaissance. Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_1
TEXT: You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_10
TEXT: If you take snapshots of the unique locations in this area, we can scrutinize them together.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_2
TEXT: The ease with which you handle Ultra Beasts is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_3

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_4
TEXT: I am endlessly fascinated by you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_5
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_6
TEXT: While you battled, I had a thought.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_7
TEXT: Your photographic observations—can they be used in other ways, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_8
TEXT: For example: if you were to take snapshots of the surrounding areas, do you think that might help us identify anomalies we’d otherwise miss if we relied only on our eyes?

TEXT: It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_1
TEXT: Thank you for your diligence, Pokémon Trainer. I will take your snapshots for further study.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_10
TEXT: We will surely find him. I will prioritize the study of your snapshots and conduct further reconnaissance on my own time—it is the least I can do in return for all that you have done for me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_11
TEXT: Until I uncover a clue, let us turn our attention back to the subject of food.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_12
TEXT: Would it benefit us to feed Pheromosa, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_13
TEXT: Perhaps the positive properties of this world’s Poffins affect Ultra Beasts as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_14
TEXT: However, Pheromosa seems reticent to engage—almost as if this world disagrees with its notion of cleanliness.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_15
TEXT: An experiment, then: let us place a Poffin on the ground so we may observe its reaction.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_16
TEXT: From a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_2
TEXT: What is that in your other hand—a Poffin? Are you hungry?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_3
TEXT: Hm. We have been walking for a while.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_4
TEXT: Let us rest, then.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_5
TEXT: Perhaps your Pokémon is also in need of nourishment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_6
TEXT: And while we are on the subject: what distinguishes Pokémon food from human food?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_7
TEXT: Your professor would have such answers? I should have known—his juice-stained coat speaks of an affinity for Berries.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_8
TEXT: Do you think he—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_9
TEXT: Apologies. It was tactless of me to speak of Willow when you are anxious about his safety.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_1
TEXT: What an oddly enjoyable endeavor, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_10
TEXT: The more we learn, the less there is to fear.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_11
TEXT: I suspect Willow feels much the sa—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_12
TEXT: Wait. Another anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_2
TEXT: Your Pokémon are lucky to have such a reliable guardian.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_3
TEXT: I’m sure they are grateful. As am I.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_4
TEXT: This entire situation would have been troublesome for me to handle alone.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_5
TEXT: Our time together has taught me much.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_6
TEXT: While you were tending to your Pokémon, I detected a promising signal from within Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_7
TEXT: It is not much, but I believe it is connected to your professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_8
TEXT: I hope this provides you with some degree of solace.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_9
TEXT: Knowledge is the great illuminator.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_10
TEXT: But enough talk. The light of your festival beckons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_11
TEXT: Thank you for sharing this experience with me today.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_12
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_2
TEXT: And from within this light emerges another form.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_4
TEXT: You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_5
TEXT: I am flattered it deemed me worthy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_6
TEXT: And I hope I may continue to be a worthy companion to you as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_7
TEXT: With UB-02 Beauty safely in your care and no other Ultra Beasts emerging, I will release you to partake in your festivities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_8

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer! I have a positive update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_2
TEXT: After analyzing the data we collected from the Ultra Wormholes, I have located—and retrieved—Professor Willow from Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_3
TEXT: His return would not have been possible without your exhaustive efforts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_4
TEXT: I do not doubt you are eager to speak with him, but he requires rest before your reunion.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_5
TEXT: Following that, I would appreciate your assistance with another matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_6
TEXT: UB-01 Symbiont and UB-02 Beauty—that is, Nihilego and Pheromosa—have once again returned to this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_7
TEXT: I need not emphasize what dangers they pose.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_8
TEXT: Additionally, new signals indicate that other Ultra Beasts may soon follow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_9
TEXT: But first, your professor. You and I can reconvene after you two have spoken.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_1

%PLAYERNAME%? Is...that you?
How long has it been? It’s good to see you. I’ve had the most amazing adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_2
TEXT: There I was, pondering the mysteries of the island guardians—and moping a little at my misfortune, I must admit—when a glowing portal appeared out of thin air!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_3
TEXT: I couldn’t help wondering what was on the other side. My curiosity ignited, I weighed the risks, grabbed my gear, and jumped right in!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_4
TEXT: The portal led to a completely different dimension—one traversed by unimaginably strange creatures...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_5
TEXT: I must tell you all about it! *yawn* But before I do, I could use a little nap. I promise I’ll spare no detail after I’ve slept...a few...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_1
TEXT: Welcome back, Pokémon Trainer. I hope you had a pleasant reunion with your professor. Has he fallen asleep? Understandable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_2
TEXT: You and I can turn our attention to the Ultra Beasts while he recuperates.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_3
TEXT: I have confirmed the reappearance of UB-02 Absorption, Buzzwole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_4
TEXT: Buzzwole’s propensity for displaying its robust musculature remains a mystery—is it mere self-satisfaction or some kind of threat?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_5
TEXT: Its sturdy physique stands in contrast to Pheromosa’s lithe frame.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_6
TEXT: Though neither should be underestimated.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer, you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_2
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_3
TEXT: An irradiant image.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_4

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_7
TEXT: Wait. An anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_6

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_1
TEXT: It’s great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_2
TEXT: I’ve received reports of strange meteorites falling around the city. And where there’s unusual activity, unusual Pokémon usually aren’t far behind!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_3
TEXT: In this case, that Pokémon is Mega Rayquaza. You’ve probably seen glimpses of it already today!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_4
TEXT: You know, I’ve recently heard theories from other researchers that that upon seeing particular meteorites, Rayquaza will remember how to use Dragon Ascent.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_5
TEXT: But there’s something even more impressive about Dragon Ascent: it allows Rayquaza to Mega Evolve!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_6
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? It makes you wonder what makes some meteorites so unique—which is precisely why I’ve asked the team leaders to help me collect samples from around here!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_7
TEXT: Now that you’re here too, why don’t you join their search? You might even learn something about Mega Rayquaza along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_0_8
TEXT: Preparation is key to any adventure, so I recommend you and your Buddy Pokémon grab a snack before setting out. You’ve got quite a day ahead of you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_1
TEXT: Hey hey, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_2
TEXT: There’re so many Trainers here. All the hustle and bustle’s really firing me up!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_3
TEXT: But you know what’s firing me up the most? Two words: Mega. Rayquaza! Pokémon battles are my thing, and Mega Rayquaza’s got red-hot strength in spades!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_4
TEXT: In fact, Mega Rayquaza’s so powerful that some folks from the Hoenn region say it’s strong enough to repel both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_5
TEXT: I’m burning  to see a Pokémon like that in action. Aren’t you?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_6
TEXT: Yeah? Then now’s our chance! It looks like Mega Rayquaza’s landed at that Gym over there!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_7
TEXT: My team’s raring to go. How about yours? Think they’re ready to test their mettle against a Mega-Evolved Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_8

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_1_9

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_3
TEXT: Same! And just between you and me, I’m taking a tour of the best food joints in town along the way.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_4
TEXT: I passed by what looked like a FIRE boba tea spot a minute ago. We’ll have to grab a sip once we’re done here!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_5
TEXT: But first, meteorites. I saw a couple fall around the streets here earlier. I’ll scoop up the ones back there, so how about you keep searching up ahead?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_6
TEXT: And don’t forget to pop an Egg in an Incubator before you go! No reason not to hatch while you, uh...catch? Meteorites, I mean. Just...pretend that made sense.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_2_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_3_10

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_3_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_3_4

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_3_9
TEXT: Since I have my hands full collecting meteorites around here, I recommend you spend your time observing Mega Rayquaza—perhaps even challenge it to battle, if you feel up to the task.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve collected a couple meteorites. Stellar work! Haha.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_3
TEXT: Did you happen to encounter Mega Rayquaza while you were exploring?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_4
TEXT: Wonderful! As you might know, Mega Evolution isn’t just about channeling strength—it’s also about your bond with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_5
TEXT: You’ve worked hard learning more about Rayquaza and collecting those peculiar meteorites.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_city_4_6
TEXT: I’m sure Rayquaza is as impressed with your perseverance as I am! In fact, if you had the opportunity, I’m sure you’d have no trouble Mega Evolving Rayquaza yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_0_2
TEXT: As if today weren’t already thrilling, I have an exciting bit of intel for you. Mega Rayquaza sightings are skyrocketing all over the world!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_0_3
TEXT: Can you believe it? Rayquaza usually inhabits the stratosphere, so seeing it is a real treat.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_0_4
TEXT: I wonder if it has anything to do with the meteor shower I saw earlier. Have you seen any of the meteorites that landed nearby?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_0_5
TEXT: I recently learned that if Rayquaza sees one of these meteorites, something mysterious happens. Oho—I’ll bet that piqued your interest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_0_6
TEXT: I’ll tell you more after you’ve had a chance to see Mega Rayquaza—or one of those meteorites—yourself!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_1_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_1_2
TEXT: Did you encounter Mega Rayquaza? Or come across one of the unusual meteorites? I do believe I promised you a juicy tidbit about those strange space rocks!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Mega Evolution is a transformation strengthened by your relationship with a Pokémon. But Mega Rayquaza is special—to Mega Evolve, it also needs to know the move Dragon Ascent.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_1_4
TEXT: And—get this—Rayquaza can only remember how to use Dragon Ascent after it sees certain meteorites. Amazing, right?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_free_rayquaza_1_5
TEXT: Now, there’s already plenty to do today, but if you find one of those inspiring meteorites and you’re confident in your bond with Rayquaza...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_1
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%, and welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2023!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_2
TEXT: You’ll never guess what I’ve found—another treasure map! This one looks like it leads to...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_3
TEXT: ...a pile of Pikachu-shaped Poffins?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_4
TEXT: Whoops. Wrong map. Here—this one! It says it leads to “a treasure so beautiful, it surpasses all others.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_5
TEXT: What do you think it could be, %PLAYERNAME%? A Pokémon? A sparkling gem? A giant lake full of ice-cold Pinap Juice?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_6
TEXT: There’s only one way to find out: by following this map!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_0_7
TEXT: The first step leads us to the PokéStops over there. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_1_1
TEXT: Phew! Nothing like a brisk walk to get the blood flowing, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_1_2
TEXT: I saw you even caught a few Pokémon on the way here. I hope you let me have a look at them later!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_1_3
TEXT: Now, the map isn’t too clear on where to go next. Instead, there are drawings depicting some of the Pokémon found in the area.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_1_4
TEXT: If we follow one of them, maybe that’ll point us in the right direction!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_1_5
TEXT: And look—there’s a whole bunch of Pokémon just ahead. Let’s see if we can make a few new friends, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_1
TEXT: That’s quite the group of Pokémon you’ve caught, %PLAYERNAME%! So lively.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_2
TEXT: They’re really putting the “fest” in Pokémon GO Fest!
...And the “Pokémon,” now that I think about it. Haha.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_3
TEXT: Seeing where they’ve led us, I’ve got a feeling we’re getting close to that treasure! Now, for the next leg...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_4
TEXT: Hm. I might’ve spoken too soon. This next stop looks pretty far away.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_5
TEXT: But isn’t that wonderful? We’ll be able to hatch some Eggs on the way there!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_2_6
TEXT: Your Buddy Pokémon might enjoy the chance to “stretch its legs,” so to speak. I know Meltan will. Er, even though it doesn’t technically have legs.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_3_1
TEXT: *huff* *huff* That was some distance we covered, huh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_3_2
TEXT: Need a little break? To be honest, I do—which is why I’m relieved our next step doesn’t appear to require movement at all!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_3_3
TEXT: Look here. The map has a drawing of an Eevee surrounded by its Evolutions.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_3_4
TEXT: I don't see any Eevee around, but one of its most unique traits is its ability to evolve into more than one Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_3_5
TEXT: Maybe it means we should evolve some Pokémon of our own. It can’t hurt to try, right?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_1
TEXT: Wh-whoa, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_2
TEXT: Look at all those pretty pink jewels! It’s enough to make my eyes gleam. That can only be the Mythical Pokémon Diancie!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_3
TEXT: I’ve heard other researchers say it’s the loveliest sight in the world—and now seeing Diancie for myself, I concur with their evaluation!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_4
TEXT: Some have even said that Diancie can instantly create many diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_5
TEXT: Picture it: Diancie sparkling in a shower of glittering diamonds! What a spectacle that would be.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_6
TEXT: All our work’s paid off. This Pokémon really is the most beautiful treasure of all!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_7
TEXT: But guess what? We haven’t even reached the end of the trail! There’s one step left.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_8
TEXT: Hmm... Here’s what it says.
“If you would polish your gem to its most brilliant sheen, take a whetstone to whimsy and build boulders to bulwarks.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_4_9
TEXT: Sounds a bit like it’s describing Diancie’s types, doesn’t it? I know—let’s power up some Rock- and Fairy-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_5_1
TEXT: Is that another jewel, %PLAYERNAME%? No...it looks to be Mega Energy for Diancie!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_5_2
TEXT: Amazing! I can’t wait to see how Diancie changes when it Mega Evolves. I can only imagine it’ll grow even more beautiful!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_5_3
TEXT: Now, I’ve already spent a dazzling day with you, so I won’t ask you to continue our research right this second.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_global_diancie_5_4

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_1
TEXT: Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m thrilled you can join me for Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_2
TEXT: We have quite the exciting day ahead of us! I’ve found something special...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_3
TEXT: a mysterious map of the park! It’s marked with a path of cryptic clues that look like they lead to something hidden—and sparkly!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_4
TEXT: Let’s follow it and see what Pokémon and treasures we find along the way.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_5
TEXT: Here’s the first clue: “Call companions out from under every rock and stone with citrine’s aroma.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_6
TEXT: Hmm...citrine gems are orange. The same shade of orange as Incense, in fact!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_0_7
TEXT: How about we use an Incense as we explore the park? The Pokémon we find might just lead us somewhere special!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_1
TEXT: So this is where those Pokémon were leading us!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_2
TEXT: But the only treasure I see is the joy on the shining  faces of all these Trainers. Including yours, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_3
TEXT: Maybe the next clue will give us more to go on.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_4
TEXT: This one reads: “Crystallize memories more glittering than gold, more valuable than diamonds.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_5
TEXT: And look—nearby locations are circled!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_6
TEXT: I scouted the park before you arrived, and I remember those spots had some stunning geology. The Pokémon inhabiting them looked happy as can be!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_7
TEXT: Even without this map, I was going to recommend that you see them for yourself! And as for crystallization, what better way to preserve a memory than with a snapshot?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_1_8
TEXT: Why don’t we follow the map and take pictures with our Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_1
TEXT: Those snapshots you took are some real gems, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m planning to put this one I took of Meltan on my fridge.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_2
TEXT: But alas—no treasure yet! Onto the next clue. I’ve got a good feeling about this one.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_3
TEXT: “When searching for a glimmering jewel, keep your eyes sharp and your aim true.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_4
TEXT: Now, I know you’d never let a Pokémon escape your notice...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_5
TEXT: But keeping steady aim when catching Pokémon can be a challenge, even for the most experienced Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_2_6
TEXT: Maybe this hint is testing our Poké Ball pitching prowess. Something tells me we’re close to discovering that “glimmering jewel”!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_1
TEXT: Wow! Is that the Pokémon I think it is, %PLAYERNAME%—the Mythical Pokémon Diancie?!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_2
TEXT: Amazing! Brilliant! Just look at those pink crystals shimmer!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_3
TEXT: Some say that Diancie’s glimmering form is the loveliest sight in the whole world, and I’m inclined to agree!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_4
TEXT: And the sparkles just keep coming! Diancie can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_5
TEXT: Exceptional work, %PLAYERNAME%. But we’re not through yet!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_6
TEXT: Here’s our next, and last, hint:

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_7
TEXT: “A trail of shimmering stardust leads to beauty beyond measure.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_3_8
TEXT: Sounds to me like we’d better hurry and start collecting Stardust!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_1
TEXT: Oh? What did you uncover, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_2
TEXT: I’ve never seen this particular Mega Energy before, but I’ll bet it can be used to Mega Evolve Diancie!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_3
TEXT: Diancie is breathtaking as it is, so I can’t wait to see what happens when it Mega Evolves. I can only imagine it’ll grow even more beautiful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_4
TEXT: If you do Mega Evolve Diancie, I’d better be first to know!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_5
TEXT: But we’ve had a long adventure already, and I don’t want to tucker you out before you get to explore the area yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_6
TEXT: Thank you for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I treasure  all the time we spend together.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_park_4_7
TEXT: I hope the rest of your day is as lovely as Mega Diancie! Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_0_2
TEXT: Wow—just look at all these Pokémon. Do you think they’re here to celebrate Pokémon GO Fest too?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_0_3
TEXT: You’re right, they probably don’t know about our human parties. But Spark has been teaching me about vibes, and I suspect these Pokémon can tell the vibes are good!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_0_4
TEXT: At any rate, there’s no sense in staying still when there are so many Pokémon we could be learning about!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_0_5
TEXT: So what are we waiting for? Let’s get catching!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_2
TEXT: While you were away, I noticed an unusual number of both Flying-type and Dragon-type Pokémon roaming about!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_3
TEXT: This is just conjecture, but I wonder if they’ve somehow sensed that Mega Rayquaza is in the area. As you might know, Rayquaza is a dual Dragon- and Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_4
TEXT: You might also know that researchers from Hoenn have said that Mega Rayquaza can manifest sufficient power to repel both Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_5
TEXT: In myths, Kyogre and Groudon are said to represent the land and seas, so keeping the peace between them is no small task!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_1_6
TEXT: Let’s power up some Flying- and Dragon-type Pokémon of our own.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_1
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_2
TEXT: After powering up those Pokémon, how do you feel? Dare I say...powerful? Why don’t you direct that energy toward challenging some Pokémon—maybe even Mega Rayquaza itself!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_3
TEXT: A word of advice: Mega Rayquaza is weak to Ice-, Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves. Keep that in mind as you plan your party!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_4
TEXT: I’ve got a feeling Mega Rayquaza might appreciate the thought you put into showing it a good and honest challenge.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_5
TEXT: After all, we can always learn something from a friendly battle—just ask Candela!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_6
TEXT: Although what I usually learn after battling Candela is that I shouldn’t try to battle Candela anymore...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_7
TEXT: Well, I hope she’s learning something from the experience, at least.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_2_8
TEXT: Now, get out there and show Mega Rayquaza everything you’ve got!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_1
TEXT: Now that’s a job well done, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_2
TEXT: Battling is a great way to learn more about both your own Pokémon and the ones you challenge.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_3
TEXT: Maybe Mega Rayquaza’s learned a little something about you from that spar, eh?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_4
TEXT: In fact, given all the time you’ve spent with Mega Rayquaza today, I have no doubt that you’d be able to Mega Evolve Rayquaza if the opportunity arises!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_5
TEXT: But first, as fun as battling can be, I’m sure your team’s a little tuckered out.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_3_6
TEXT: Let’s catch some Pokémon while your team catches their breath!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_1
TEXT: Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m nearly tripping over all the Pokémon you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_2
TEXT: And how are your Pokémon feeling? Ready to tackle the rest of the day?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_3
TEXT: Great! That’s what I like to hear.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_4
TEXT: So, what will you do next? Search for Mega Rayquaza? Track down an elusive Pokémon? Spend some time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_5
TEXT: All great options! Whatever you choose, thanks again for joining me for this year’s Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2023_ticketed_rayquaza_4_6

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#2
TEXT: I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#3
TEXT: At first, I was impressed by your dedication, but now you’ve become a nuisance. This festival is mine.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#2
TEXT: I know I’ll be disappointed in your battling, so let’s just get this over with.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#3
TEXT: Might as well pass the time with a battle, considering your little event is ruined.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#1
TEXT: This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#2
TEXT: You must have some kind of special power on your side that made you win. That’s the only explanation...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#1

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Check this out—I’ve been practicing.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon GO! My name is Willow. People call me the Pokémon Prof!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! Some people keep Pokémon as companions. Others have them do battle. Myself? I study Pokémon as a profession.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: Did that remind you of anyone? For many years, Trainers from Kanto have heard similar remarks before embarking on their journeys through the region.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I have the honor of making them today because you’re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: But we can’t have you leaving unprepared! I’ve put together some supplies I think you’ll find useful.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Berries, Potions, and Poké Balls. Looks like you’re all set!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: As you begin today’s adventure, try to imagine you’re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I have a feeling you’ll meet a Pokémon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pokémon you encounter along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: On adventures, I find it’s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I’m sure you’ll make plenty of both!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's GO!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: How’s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pokémon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pokémon, #001 in the Pokédex. This Grass-type Pokémon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it’s born.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pokémon. It’s a Fire-type Pokémon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Last—but certainly not least—is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pokémon. After birth, this Water-type Pokémon's back swells and hardens into a shell.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Each of these Pokémon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it’s time to get back to your adventure.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: I’d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon is of utmost importance!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you’re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you’ll become even closer in no time.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only are the relationships you build with your Pokémon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you’re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I’m sure they’d love to hear from you!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pokémon you might not have otherwise encountered.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: And not only do you get a new entry in your Pokédex, but you also get a new friend!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: You’ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it’s time to show off the skills you’ve learned along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pokémon? Don’t forget to make use of your Berries, too.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_5
TEXT: I’m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pokémon you’re catching—and they’re tasty to boot!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: I’m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: I’ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I’m very impressed! It seems there’s no challenge you can’t overcome.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: As I’m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pokémon in raids.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pokémon and bolster your team.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_4
TEXT: While you focus on that, I’ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_5
TEXT: There have been reports of encounters with a Pokémon that’s able to transform into another Pokémon entirely. Fascinating stuff!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_6
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_0
TEXT: Glad you’re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_2
TEXT: However, there seems to be something more to this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_3
TEXT: Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_4
TEXT: I’ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I’m stunned!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_1
TEXT: You’ve had quite the journey, haven’t you? It’s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, though, there’s still another mystery that needs solving.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: You see, after looking over the research you’ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pokémon, Mew.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: We've documented Mew in the past, but something’s different this time—though I can’t yet say what that is.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: Whatever the case, I think it’s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_6
TEXT: In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I’m sure you’re up to it!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_7
TEXT: For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today’s Kanto-themed journey!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_8
TEXT: I hope you were able to make some special memories with your Pokémon and fellow Trainers. Thanks again for all your help and hard work!

RESOURCE ID: invasion_find_leader_onboarding__spark_speaker|1

RESOURCE ID: invasion_map_fragment_onboarding__blanche_speaker|1

RESOURCE ID: invasion_map_fragment_onboarding__blanche_speaker|2

RESOURCE ID: invasion_map_fragment_onboarding__blanche_speaker|3

RESOURCE ID: invasion_shadow_gem_1_onboarding__professor_willow_speaker|1

RESOURCE ID: invasion_shadow_gem_2_onboarding__professor_willow_speaker|1

RESOURCE ID: invasion_shadow_onboarding__candela_speaker|1

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_00

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_01
TEXT: Several Trainers across the region claim to have seen something strange going on with their shadows.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_02
TEXT: I’m pretty sure the reports align with something I put down in my older research, but I have to find my notes before I can confirm my theory.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_00_03
TEXT: If you’re up for it, let’s go with a tried-and-true play: I’ll search my archives, and you can go out and investigate. Your field observations could prove invaluable!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_00
TEXT: Yo, %PLAYERNAME%! You looking for the prof? He just bolted by a second ago. He had a big old notebook with him!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_01
TEXT: The vibes around here have been mega off lately, what with all the weird shadows creeping people out! I mean, not that I’m scared or anything. I’m cool like a cucumber, you know?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_02
TEXT: But hey, if you wanted to take a break from shadow-hunting, we could hang a bit, trade some battle strats, maybe grab a quick snack?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_01_03
TEXT: No? Yeah, I guess you’re right, finding Professor Willow is probably the priority!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_00
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. I see my appearance has caught you off guard. Rest assured, you did not startle me.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_01
TEXT: You’re looking for Professor Willow, correct? I saw him moments ago, though his behavior was somewhat...unusual. It looked as though he was tracking something through the shadows, off in that direction.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_02
TEXT: These shadowy anomalies you’ve likely heard about—I’ve been studying them myself, though my observations have yet to yield definitive conclusions.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_02_03
TEXT: Perhaps your own investigation will prove more fruitful. But be cautious, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_00
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You after Professor Willow, too?

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_01
TEXT: You know all these weird shadows? They’re no random occurrence. There’s something moving through them. Something interesting.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_02
TEXT: While Blanche is doing the analyzing thing and Spark is jumping at every shadow, I say you and me tackle this thing head-on!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_03_03
TEXT: Just remember, keep that fighting spirit burning, %PLAYERNAME%! Whatever’s out there is testing us!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_00
TEXT: Found you at last, %PLAYERNAME%! We must’ve been walking right past each other in all these shadows.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_01
TEXT: I’ve cross-referenced our recent field data against my old notes, and I managed to identify the source of these mysterious occurrences!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_02
TEXT: A powerful presence is out there, observing Trainers and their Pokémon. Based on the data, it should be nearby, too.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_03
TEXT: We’re looking at a massive research opportunity here—and you’re the perfect Trainer for the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_04_04
TEXT: Get out there and investigate the thing that’s causing all these odd shadows—but remember to be careful. We don’t know for sure what lies in the darkness!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_00
TEXT: Exceptional work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_01
TEXT: The strange shadows were actually the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow, hiding in plain sight! Well, plain-ish.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_02
TEXT: Following its trail through the darkness got us closer than we realized, but it took someone with your special connection to Pokémon to finally draw it into the light.

RESOURCE ID: marshadow_sr_05_03

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_1
TEXT: I ask because a nearby forest has been looking pretty lush lately.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_2
TEXT: It reminded me of some old stories I came across back in my student days.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_3
TEXT: There are accounts from different eras that describe trees flourishing in the forest along with the appearance of a particular Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_4
TEXT: I wonder if any of those tales are true. I’ll have to dig into my notes and find the name of the Pokémon they’re referring to.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Have you had a chance to observe any of the surrounding locations?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_1
TEXT: Whenever I find myself getting lost in my notes, I like to take breaks near trees in the area.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_2
TEXT: Oh, speaking of my notes—the Pokémon in the stories I was talking about earlier turns out to have been Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_3
TEXT: And—this is the really juicy part—Celebi is known as the Time Travel Pokémon. It came here from the future by crossing over time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_4
TEXT: Sounds right out of a myth, right? Let’s keep investigating and see if the phenomenon I observed is connected to Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I was just looking for you! Did you turn up anything interesting in your own investigation?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_1
TEXT: I actually think I spotted Celebi in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_2
TEXT: It seemed like it was bolstering the grass and trees around it—and that matches what’s recorded about it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_3
TEXT: Its coloring was different than expected, though. What could that mean?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_4
TEXT: Whatever the answer, we ought to keep an eye out for our fantastical forest friend.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_0
TEXT: I’ve been looking inward a lot lately—meditative, even. I wonder if it’s due to Celebi’s presence?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_1
TEXT: They say that it only appears during peaceful times...

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_2
TEXT: Well, if that’s true, I hope it stays with us for a long time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_3
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? Have you felt inspired by the calm?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_4
TEXT: It might be nice to spend some time basking in the serenity around us with your buddy!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_0
TEXT: I saw Celebi again! It flew off when I tried to approach, but I found an egg near where I spotted it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_1
TEXT: According to my research, Celebi is said to leave behind an egg it brought from the future, so I can’t wait to study this one!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_2
TEXT: This is a good sign! We’re going to have another encounter with Celebi—I can just feel it!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_3
TEXT: You keep up the good work exploring—and make sure you’re prepared for when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_4
TEXT: It’s no small feat to catch a Mythical Pokémon like Celebi, but I’m sure you have what it takes!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_0
TEXT: Yes! You’ve done brilliantly, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m so proud of you for seeing this task through.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_1
TEXT: And what a worthwhile task it was! Just look at the hue on your new friend there—this is a Shiny Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_2
TEXT: It’s thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_3
TEXT: And if you ask me, your contribution towards that future will be nothing short of mythical!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_4

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: With the team leaders’ help, we managed to pinpoint Apex Shadow Ho-Oh’s location. For reasons unknown, Team GO Rocket’s keeping the two Pokémon in separate locations.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Perhaps they’ve bitten off more than they can chew with these two Legendary Pokémon? In any case, this makes things easier for us: we’ll save these Pokémon one at a time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_4

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_5

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Do you have everything you need, %PLAYERNAME%? Potions? Revives? Snacks?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: Saving Apex Shadow Lugia will be an even greater challenge, so be prepared.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has hidden Apex Shadow Lugia away in a secret hideout, guarded by a gauntlet of Grunts—and standing with them is none other than Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: And while I have you, remember how I said I’d conduct more research into Apex Shadow Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Well, it turns out that if you purify it, its Sacred Fire move will become immeasurably powerful.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Apex Purified Ho-Oh might be an incredible ally in our quest to save Apex Shadow Lugia.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_6
TEXT: These may just be some of the toughest battles you’ll face as a Pokémon Trainer yet. But I know you, above all else, are the one most prepared for the challenge.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_2

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: You saved Apex Shadow Lugia from Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Just like Ho-Oh, Apex Shadow Lugia’s Aeroblast attack is more powerful than any I’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: And just like Apex Shadow Ho-Oh, I’m confident that its power will increase even more if you purify it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_6

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_7

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_00_03

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_00_04
TEXT: It sounds like we need to locate the Wish Pokémon for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_00_05

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_00_07
TEXT: Maybe researching one of those Pokémon will give us the lead we need!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! No Jirachi leads, I’m afraid, but seeing you catch those Pokémon made me think about how much you’ve grown in your journey as a Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: Ah! I’ve got an idea! “I wish we knew where to find Jirachi!”

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Oh well—I suppose Jirachi’s not granting that particular wish. It was worth a shot!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_04
TEXT: But that’s enough wishing from me. Say...what do you think your Pokémon would wish for?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_05
TEXT: To spend some time together? Or maybe to share a tasty snack?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_01_06
TEXT: Why don’t you take a moment to get in tune with your Pokémon’s wishes, %PLAYERNAME%, while I noodle on more ways to locate Jirachi.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_00
TEXT: You and your Pokémon are looking refreshed and ready to continue the search for Jirachi, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_01
TEXT: Something occurred to me while you were away—Jirachi was originally discovered in the Hoenn region, as you may already know.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_02
TEXT: But it’s not the only elusive Pokémon first discovered in that region.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_03
TEXT: It shares that honor with Kecleon, the Color Swap Pokémon. Kecleon can change the colors of its body at will to blend in with its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_04
TEXT: There’s one exception—it can’t change the zigzag pattern on its belly. Looking for that distinctive pattern is the key to spotting Kecleon, but even that trick doesn’t make it easy!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_05
TEXT: I was years into my Pokémon studies before I came across my first Kecleon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_06
TEXT: Have you encountered a Kecleon yet? Who knows how many times you’ve been standing right next to one without knowing it!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_02_07
TEXT: I’ve heard Trainers have had luck finding Kecleon around PokéStops. Maybe Jirachi’s taken up the same proclivity for hiding!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: You’ve got sharp eyes, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve never seen so many Kecleon in one place. It’s rare to see any Kecleon at all, with their expert camouflaging skills.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: Unfortunately for us, it seems like Jirachi might be even harder to spot than Kecleon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: But I, for one, am undaunted! Keeping your confidence and spirits high is key both in research and in life, I say.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: Maybe what we need is a little dash of luck to move us ahead.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: And what’s luckier than a Lucky Pokémon, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_00
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Feeling any luckier with your new Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_01
TEXT: I know I am! I’ve got a good feeling that Jirachi is closer than ever.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_02
TEXT: Now let’s put that luck to use with some good old-fashioned exploring!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_03
TEXT: We can take some inspiration from Jirachi’s sleep schedule.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_04
TEXT: As you know, Jirachi is only awake for seven days out of  a thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_05
TEXT: So how about you try dedicating seven days to research? Or catching a thousand Pokémon? I know it’s a lot to ask, but maybe Jirachi will appreciate the perseverance.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_04_06
TEXT: Although I hope you’ll be around to help me with my research for a lot longer than a week, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it—you’ve found our elusive Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_01
TEXT: It was no easy task, but you persevered through thick and thin. You’ve done me proud again!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_02
TEXT: It seems our new friend really is different from the Jirachi observed a few years ago. This is a Shiny Jirachi, as I’m sure you’ve noticed from its unique coloring!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_03
TEXT: I wonder if it has different habits. Does its sleep schedule differ? What about its temperament?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_04
TEXT: Ahem. Sorry about that. It’s hard to contain my excitement when I think about all there is to learn about Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_shiny_jirachi_sr_dialog_05_05

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to have you aboard this expedition. Say, have you ever heard this particular tune?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Da da da doo, da dee da dum... That’s what I hear in my head when I think of a certain sailor and his Wingull that I met while traveling through the Hoenn region in my younger years.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: I believe the tune was originally a sea shanty. Sailors would sing songs like this together on their seafaring adventures to keep morale high and help find a rhythm during certain tasks.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I’m no sailor, but I do find myself feeling luckier after humming it! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: Anyway, we’re here to look into the strange situation we uncovered during your Kanto-themed journey.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: I’m talking, of course, about reports of encounters with Mew, the New Species Pokémon. There have been several sightings of a Shiny one recently, which is tremendously exciting!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: That means our goal on this expedition is to find not only one of the most elusive Pokémon to ever exist, but a Shiny one at that!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_7
TEXT: You’ve experienced a lot on your journeys thus far, %PLAYERNAME%. But perhaps the most wonderful thing about Pokémon is that there’s always something new to discover.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_8
TEXT: I hope you’re excited for what’s to come, because I have a feeling it’s going to be a real test of your skills as a Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_9
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%—great work! Your knowledge of the Kanto region is beginning to rival even my own!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: Our next task is to learn more about Pokémon DNA.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I know that sounds pretty heavy on the science, but don’t worry—I’ll take care of that part. All I need you to do is get out there and catch lots of different types of Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so to better understand Mew, we should try to understand as much as we can about the genetics of other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing you learn so much about different Pokémon reminded me of how vast the world of Pokémon truly is.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Knowledge is funny in that the more we gain, the more realize how much we still lack. Some might find that frustrating, but for me it’s inspiring!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: You know, there’s a part in that sea shanty I mentioned before that seems applicable here.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: I don’t remember the exact words, but the gist is that we should travel across the land, searching far and wide to learn about all the amazing Pokémon there are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Words to live by, I say! Let’s get out there and track down that Shiny Mew, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you... You did it! You actually found and caught a Shiny Mew!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: Has it even sunk in yet? This is a monumental achievement, Trainer. Take a moment to congratulate yourself!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Hm? It’s my achievement as well? Haha! No, no, I just hummed you a shanty and guided you like any Pokémon Professor worth their sea salt would.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: But thanks are certainly in order for the Pokémon you’ve befriended on your journey. They played a big part in your research, after all!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: The ones you’ve caught, the ones you’ve battled with, and the ones that traveled with you as your buddy—each Pokémon played a critical part in helping you achieve this goal.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: As Trainers, we owe an eternal debt to our Pokémon. After all, we can’t very well be Trainers without them!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: A Trainer’s journey is meant to be filled with amazing memories, ambitious dreams, and unexpected adventures. I think this particular journey checked all those boxes pretty handily!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_7

You can always Mega Evolve a Pokémon using Mega Energy even if the Pokémon is in a rest period. The Mega Energy required to do so will depend on the length of the rest period.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0000
TEXT: --

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0001
TEXT: Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0002
TEXT: There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0003
TEXT: There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0003_0169_2
TEXT: In battle, this Pokémon swings around two thick vines. If these vines slammed into a 10-story building, they could easily topple it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0004
TEXT: The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0005
TEXT: Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0006
TEXT: Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0006_0178_2
TEXT: This colossal, flame-winged figure of a Charizard was brought about by Gigantamax energy.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0007
TEXT: Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0008
TEXT: Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0009
TEXT: Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0009_0187_2
TEXT: It’s not very good at precision shooting. When attacking, it just fires its 31 cannons over and over and over.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0010
TEXT: Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0011
TEXT: The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0012
TEXT: Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0012_0959_2
TEXT: Crystallized Gigantamax energy makes up this Pokémon’s blindingly bright and highly toxic scales.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0013
TEXT: Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0014
TEXT: Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0015
TEXT: Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0016
TEXT: Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0017
TEXT: Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0018
TEXT: This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0019
TEXT: Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0019_0046
TEXT: Night after night, they sneak into people's homes seeking food. A massive outbreak of them has become an issue of public concern.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0020
TEXT: Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0020_0048
TEXT: It commands a nest of Rattata. Different nests don't get along, whipping up severe fights over feeding grounds.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0021
TEXT: Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0022
TEXT: Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0023
TEXT: Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0024
TEXT: This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crushing embrace is impossible.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0025
TEXT: Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0025_0598_2
TEXT: Its Gigantamax power expanded, forming its supersized body and towering tail.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0026
TEXT: If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon's nest.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0026_0050
TEXT: When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you'll also get a light shock!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0027
TEXT: Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0027_0052
TEXT: The skin on its back is as hard as steel. Predators go after its soft belly, so it clings to the ground desperately.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0028
TEXT: Sandslash's body is covered by tough spikes, which are hardened sections of its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall out, to be replaced with new spikes that grow out from beneath the old ones.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0028_0054
TEXT: A long, long time ago, it lived in the desert. With its sharp claws fully extended, it can climb right up an iceberg without slipping.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0029
TEXT: Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0030
TEXT: When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0031
TEXT: Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0032
TEXT: Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0033
TEXT: Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0034
TEXT: Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0035
TEXT: On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0036
TEXT: Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0037
TEXT: At the time of its birth, Vulpix has one white tail. The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0037_0056
TEXT: They live together in a skulk, helping one another. Before eating their prey, they freeze it solid with their –58 degree Fahrenheit breath.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0038
TEXT: Ninetales casts a sinister light from its bright red eyes to gain total control over its foe's mind. This Pokémon is said to live for a thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0038_0058
TEXT: Some said that deities visited mountains where Ninetales live, so in times long past, no one was allowed to go into those mountains.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0039
TEXT: Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pokémon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0040
TEXT: Wigglytuff has large, saucerlike eyes. The surfaces of its eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears. If any dust gets in this Pokémon's eyes, it is quickly washed away.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0041
TEXT: Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0042
TEXT: Golbat loves to drink the blood of living things. It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking fresh blood.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0043
TEXT: During the daytime, Oddish buries itself in soil to absorb nutrients from the ground using its entire body. The more fertile the soil, the glossier its leaves become.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0044
TEXT: Gloom releases a foul fragrance from the pistil of its flower. When faced with danger, the stench worsens. If this Pokémon is feeling calm and secure, it does not release its usual stinky aroma.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0045
TEXT: Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0046
TEXT: Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0047
TEXT: Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0048
TEXT: Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0049
TEXT: Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0050
TEXT: Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0050_0060
TEXT: The need to dig through volcanic rock in the ground has made them more powerful than the Diglett of other regions.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0051
TEXT: Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0051_0062
TEXT: Its shining gold whiskers are advanced sensors that can detect vibrations from sounds several miles away.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0052
TEXT: Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0052_0063_2
TEXT: The pattern that has appeared on its giant coin is thought to be the key to unlocking the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0052_0064
TEXT: A royal house that flourished in the distant past brought it here from another region. Meowth is both selfish and prideful.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0052_2335
TEXT: Living with a savage, seafaring people has toughened this Pokémon's body so much that parts of it have turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0053
TEXT: Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0053_0066
TEXT: Its round face is a symbol of wealth. Persian that have bigger, plumper faces are considered more beautiful.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0054
TEXT: Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0055
TEXT: The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic swimmer.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0056
TEXT: When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0057
TEXT: When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0058
TEXT: Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0058_2792
TEXT: They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0059
TEXT: Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0059_2793
TEXT: Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0060
TEXT: Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0061
TEXT: The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0062
TEXT: Although it’s skilled in a style of dynamic swimming that uses all its muscles, for some reason it lives on dry land.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0063
TEXT: Abra sleeps for 18 hours a day. However, it can sense the presence of foes even while it is sleeping. In such a situation, this Pokémon immediately teleports to safety.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0064
TEXT: Kadabra emits a peculiar alpha wave if it develops a headache. Only those people with a particularly strong psyche can hope to become a Trainer of this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0065
TEXT: Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0066
TEXT: Machop's muscles are special—they never get sore no matter how much they are used in exercise. This Pokémon has sufficient power to hurl a hundred adult humans.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0067
TEXT: Machoke's thoroughly toned muscles possess the hardness of steel. This Pokémon has so much strength, it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler on just one finger.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0068
TEXT: Machamp has the power to hurl anything aside. However, trying to do any work requiring care and dexterity causes its arms to get tangled. This Pokémon tends to leap into action before it thinks.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0068_0815_2
TEXT: The Gigantamax energy coursing through its arms makes its punches hit as hard as bomb blasts.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0069
TEXT: Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0070
TEXT: Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0071
TEXT: Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0072
TEXT: Tentacool's body is largely composed of water. If it is removed from the sea, it dries up like parchment. If this Pokémon happens to become dehydrated, put it back into the sea.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0073
TEXT: Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0074
TEXT: The longer a Geodude lives, the more its edges are chipped and worn away, making it more rounded in appearance. However, this Pokémon's heart will remain hard, craggy, and rough always.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0074_0068
TEXT: Geodude compete against each other with headbutts. The iron sand on their heads will stick to whichever one has stronger magnetism.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0075
TEXT: Graveler grows by feeding on rocks. Apparently, it prefers to eat rocks that are covered in moss. This Pokémon eats its way through a ton of rocks on a daily basis.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0075_0070
TEXT: Graveler's entire body is tinged with electricity due to the stones it likes to eat. It's very quick-tempered.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0076
TEXT: Golem live up on mountains. If there is a large earthquake, these Pokémon will come rolling down off the mountains en masse to the foothills below.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0076_0072
TEXT: It shoots large rocks that are charged with electricity. Tremendous electric shocks are flung out across the whole area of impact.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0077
TEXT: Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0077_2336
TEXT: Its small horn hides a healing power. With a few rubs from this Pokémon’s horn, any slight wound you have will be healed.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0078
TEXT: Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0078_2337
TEXT: Little can stand up to its psycho cut. Unleashed from this Pokémon’s horn, the move will punch a hole right through a thick metal sheet.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0079
TEXT: Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0079_2582

RESOURCE ID: primal_rumblings_sr_dialog_00_01

RESOURCE ID: primal_rumblings_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: There were Pinap Berry seeds in the pocket of my spare coat, and they started sprouting overnight! And that’s to say nothing of the tree growing through my bed. Makes it hard to saw logs, if you’ll excuse the pun.

TEXT: The only word I can think of to describe this phenomenon is “primal”!

RESOURCE ID: primal_rumblings_sr_dialog_01_04
TEXT: When there’s an overabundance of natural energy, the Pokémon Kyogre and Groudon can absorb that energy to revert to their primal forms, dramatically increasing their power.

RESOURCE ID: primal_rumblings_sr_dialog_01_05
TEXT: Some even say those are their true forms. As a professor, of course I’d love to study them up close! But Pokémon that mighty can sow chaos if left unchecked for long.

RESOURCE ID: primal_rumblings_sr_dialog_01_06
TEXT: But don’t worry, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ve sent the team leaders and Rhi on a mission to find the Red and Blue Orbs. According to the literature of the Hoenn region, the orbs are ancient artifacts with the power to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.

Any information that you provide on or to a Third Party Service or that is collected by a Third Party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third Party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy.

Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health App Data”).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pokémon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get “credit” in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pokémon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pokémon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_0
TEXT: You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. While searching for clues to your professor’s whereabouts, I uncovered an odd device among his belongings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_1
TEXT: This contraption appears similar to your Incense, but the color and scent are distinctive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_2
TEXT: You have not seen this before either? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps it is an entirely new invention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_4
TEXT: Affixed to it were several notes, though I have not read them all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_5
TEXT: If you take the device, then I will examine what is written.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_6
TEXT: Please give me some moments.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_0
TEXT: The notes were indeed enlightening, Pokémon Trainer. Your professor calls this device “Daily Adventure Incense.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_1
TEXT: Upon activation, it will attract Pokémon to your location for 15 minutes—so long as you are moving.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_2
TEXT: The professor has arranged that one be made available to you each day. His writings indicate a sincere hope that this invention will facilitate new friendships and adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_3
TEXT: What rare components must this device contain?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_4
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_5
TEXT: Let us activate it and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for the demonstration, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_1
TEXT: I see potential in this device.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_2
TEXT: It appears to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what one would expect to encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_3
TEXT: How clever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_4
TEXT: The professor’s creativity and thoughtfulness is admirable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_5
TEXT: I eagerly anticipate the day I meet him. The tools of this world are fascinating, but the people...even more so.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part1_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve been testing a new type of Incense that I can’t wait for you to try. I call it—Daily Adventure Incense!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part1_0_1
TEXT: You’ll notice that aside from its color, it smells a bit different from the Incense you’re familiar with. But that’s not all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part1_0_2
TEXT: It also—whoops! Listen to me ramble. I know you’re busy as a Combee. When you’ve got more time, come back and I’ll show you how it works.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! Now let me teach you how to use Daily Adventure Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_1
TEXT: You can activate this unique Incense while you’re out and about to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what you might expect to encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_2
TEXT: It only lasts for 15 minutes, but don’t worry—I’ll make sure to fix you up with a new one each day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_3
TEXT: Daily Adventure Incense works best when you’re actively moving, so it’s best not to use it while you’re taking a break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_4
TEXT: Excited? Me too! Now let’s give it a whirl, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_0
TEXT: I see you’ve made some new Pokémon friends already, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s have a look!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_1
TEXT: Hm...

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_2
TEXT: Very interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_3
TEXT: Some of these Pokémon aren’t usually seen around here. Pretty neat, huh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_4
TEXT: Thanks for trying out Daily Adventure Incense. Who knows—if you keep using it, you might end up seeing something legendary!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_5
TEXT: Take care, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_1
TEXT: Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_2
TEXT: Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_3
TEXT: When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_4
TEXT: At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_5
TEXT: While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_1
TEXT: After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_2
TEXT: When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_3
TEXT: That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_4
TEXT: You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_5
TEXT: The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_6
TEXT: Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1
TEXT: Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2
TEXT: Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3
TEXT: As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1
TEXT: I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2
TEXT: She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3
TEXT: Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4
TEXT: This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5
TEXT: One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6
TEXT: I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1
TEXT: With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3
TEXT: Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4
TEXT: I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5
TEXT: I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6
TEXT: You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1
TEXT: I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2
TEXT: At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3
TEXT: These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4
TEXT: Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0
TEXT: Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1
TEXT: This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2
TEXT: I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0
TEXT: As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1
TEXT: I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2
TEXT: Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3
TEXT: If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1
TEXT: We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2
TEXT: Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3
TEXT: Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1
TEXT: I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2
TEXT: We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3
TEXT: Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1
TEXT: I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2
TEXT: I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3
TEXT: Could I ask you to investigate these reports?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1
TEXT: Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2
TEXT: I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3
TEXT: As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1
TEXT: Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2
TEXT: I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3
TEXT: These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4
TEXT: What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0
TEXT: That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1
TEXT: The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3
TEXT: It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4
TEXT: I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0
TEXT: Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1
TEXT: What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_2
TEXT: We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3
TEXT: First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_4
TEXT: Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_0
TEXT: Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1
TEXT: A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_2
TEXT: It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_3
TEXT: I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_1
TEXT: The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_2
TEXT: That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_3
TEXT: Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_0
TEXT: Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1
TEXT: I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2
TEXT: If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_3
TEXT: The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_4
TEXT: We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1
TEXT: It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2
TEXT: Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_3
TEXT: If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_0
TEXT: It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_1
TEXT: Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_2
TEXT: We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_3
TEXT: I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_4
TEXT: If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_0
TEXT: Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_1
TEXT: That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_2
TEXT: You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_3
TEXT: You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_0
TEXT: Well, well! If it isn’t my favorite research assistant!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_1
TEXT: Your timing couldn’t be better. I had a meeting with Silph Co. the other day where they asked for help catching a large number of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_2
TEXT: Seeing as you’re already here, would you mind lending a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_3
TEXT: ...Great! I knew I could count on you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll check in with you again soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_1_0
TEXT: Incredible, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_1_1
TEXT: Keep it up—I suspect your efforts will be well rewarded.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_0
TEXT: Amazing job, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_1
TEXT: As a thank-you for your dedication, Silph Co. is offering to send over one of their most valuable inventions: a Master Ball!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_2
TEXT: As you may already know, a Master Ball is no ordinary Poké Ball. With it, you can catch any wild Pokémon without fail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_3
TEXT: Now that’s what I call a scientific marvel!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_4
TEXT: An opportunity like this doesn’t come around often. I’m glad you’ll be the one to seize it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_5
TEXT: You’re almost to the finish line, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_0
TEXT: How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_1
TEXT: Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_2
TEXT: I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_3
TEXT: And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_winterwishes23_0_0

TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was hoping to see. Have you been enjoying the festival?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: I was just out on a stroll and witnessed the most incredible sight. Several rings had appeared in the sky, and as I stared up at them, something truly remarkable occurred.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Legendary Pokémon began emerging from the rings as if by magic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: Naturally, I rushed back to my laboratory and began frantically searching through every book I thought might shed some light on what had happened—but I’ve yet to find anything.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’m going to keep looking, but in the meantime, I could really use your help investigating in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: We have to find out what’s going on here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for collecting that information, Trainer. I’m going to send it over to Blanche for analysis. Unfortunately, the rings in the sky have yet to disappear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: I did have some luck in my search for an explanation, however. Look here—it’s the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa enjoys sending things to faraway places using its rings, which can warp space.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: That explains why those Legendary Pokémon appeared the way they did. Hoopa uses those rings to move things from place to place—including itself. It won’t be easy to catch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Based on reports from the team leaders, it doesn’t seem like Hoopa is in the area at the moment. Let’s use this time to prepare to catch it, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Mischievous though Hoopa may be, you have to admit that its rings are quite fascinating, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_6
TEXT: Moments like this remind me of why I became a Pokémon Professor in the first place. The world of Pokémon is endlessly exciting!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_7
TEXT: For now, why don’t you go challenge some raids with other Trainers and catch some Pokémon? You’ll need your skills at their sharpest to catch Hoopa. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_2
TEXT: Er...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_4
TEXT: Oh, thank goodness. I’ve had the most befuddling day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_5
TEXT: The Pokémon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why—but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_6
TEXT: The next thing I knew, “you” had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pokémon I’ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_7
TEXT: Hm? You noticed it too, did you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_8
TEXT: And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_9
TEXT: As you’ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s...it’s...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_1
TEXT: It’s the Pidgey! They’ve flown the coop!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_2
TEXT: For years, Trainers like yourself have been sending me Pidgey to research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_3
TEXT: I’ve kept each and every one safe and healthy, feeding them the best Berries, providing them with the softest nests...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_4
TEXT: But somehow they’ve escaped from my lab! Maybe this is what I get for using a Great Fence instead of an Ultra Fence.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_5
TEXT: *sigh* And after all the care I put into everyone’s Pidgey, too. We’ve got a real whirlwind of a situation on our hands!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_6
TEXT: On the bright side, this might make for a fascinating paper on the impact of the flighty flock on the local environment...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_7
TEXT: But first things first. Help me catch as many of these plucky Pidgey as you can, %PLAYERNAME%! Before they try to fly off with my whole trailer...or me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%? %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_1
TEXT: Phew! I was worried the Pidgey might’ve blown you away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_2
TEXT: Most of the Pidgey are back safe in the lab, thanks to you and your fellow Trainers! I’m so glad it wasn’t a gust—er, bust.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_3
TEXT: Take these items for your help with today’s feathery fracas, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_4
TEXT: I’ve put in an order for double the Pidgey’s usual amount of Berries, so let's hope they’ll feel pampered enough not to be a flight risk anymore.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_5
TEXT: That’s enough fun for one day, I’d say. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn’t it lovely out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_1
TEXT: There are Litten lying in the sun, Rowlet relaxing in the trees, Popplio playing in the water—and these malasadas Spark dropped off sure are delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_2
TEXT: It seems even the flowers smell sweeter today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see what Pokémon are around, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe we’ll find something new to research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll sit this one out. Taking breaks is important!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back already, %PLAYERNAME%—and with some new Pokémon in tow! Well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_1
TEXT: While you were gone, I noticed there’s something sparkling in the air today. Perhaps it’s a result of my radiant personality, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_2
TEXT: Haha! Seriously though, it’s something I’m looking into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_3
TEXT: For now, let’s have a look at the Pokémon you’ve caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_4
TEXT: Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pokémon that are often found on Alola’s Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_5
TEXT: Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_6
TEXT: There’s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park—which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_7
TEXT: How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokémon while you’re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pokémon often seen about Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s quite an assortment of Pokémon you’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_1
TEXT: I wish I’d been out there with you, but I wasn’t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_2
TEXT: You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pokémon behind a flower bush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_3
TEXT: Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_4
TEXT: The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele’s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_5
TEXT: Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let’s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_0
TEXT: Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_1
TEXT: I wasn’t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I’ve been seeing in the air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_2
TEXT: They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_3
TEXT: How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_4
TEXT: *gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_5
TEXT: So, we’ve been visited by two of Alola’s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_6
TEXT: Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we’re staying on its good side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_7
TEXT: If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they’re appearing...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_8
TEXT: But that’s for me to ponder. Don’t trouble yourself with it—go out and enjoy the day! I’ll be in touch soon. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1
TEXT: Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2
TEXT: When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3
TEXT: However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1
TEXT: It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3
TEXT: I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0
TEXT: I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1
TEXT: While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2
TEXT: Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3
TEXT: While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0
TEXT: Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1
TEXT: We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2
TEXT: Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve got something for you to sink your teeth into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_1
TEXT: Have you noticed the peculiar marks on the trees and boulders in the area? And the crushed berries on the ground?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_2
TEXT: While I’m a little disappointed in today’s Pinap Berry harvest, I’ve got a feeling that a Pokémon is responsible—and that means we have something to research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_3
TEXT: And I’ll bet you even have an idea what Pokémon we’ll be investigating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_4
TEXT: Why don’t you search the area and let me know what you find?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_1
TEXT: Aha! So Axew are responsible for those unique marks and crushed berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_2
TEXT: These Pokémon play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Crushing berries is how they test each other’s strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_3
TEXT: Axew tusks are sharp enough that people long ago used them as cooking knives!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_4
TEXT: These Pokémon find culinary uses for their tusks in the wild, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_5
TEXT: Fraxure, Axew’s Evolution, uses its thick tusks to neatly cut prey into two portions—one to eat now and one to save for later.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_6
TEXT: Fascinating, isn’t it? I wish I had that kind of restraint!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_7
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving one of your Axew? Maybe I can get some tips for my meal prepping!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_0
TEXT: Look at this fine Fraxure, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_1
TEXT: Now that you’ve got one of your own, here are a few more Fraxure facts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_2
TEXT: Their territory battles can be intensely violent, and their tusks can shatter rocks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_3
TEXT: But the tusks don’t grow back once they break, so Fraxure won’t use them unless truly necessary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_4
TEXT: Even so, getting up close to one has me on edge—not unlike the sharp edges of their tusks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_5
TEXT: Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_6
TEXT: No? Ah well. So much for my sharp wit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_7
TEXT: Anyway, it’s a good thing that Haxorus, Fraxure’s Evolution, has a kind disposition.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_8
TEXT: Why don’t you evolve Fraxure so we can see for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_0
TEXT: Your Haxorus’s tusks are positively gleaming!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_1
TEXT: Or should I say beaming? Those sturdy tusks can cut steel beams and stay sharp! Haxorus are covered in great armor, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_2
TEXT: They’re docile, but they’ll become incredibly angry if their tusks are touched. Understandable—both Pokémon and people have different sensitivities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_3
TEXT: Some of us are huggers, like me and Spark! But Blanche, ah, isn’t.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_4
TEXT: Nothing’s wrong with either, of course! It’s all part of what makes each person, and Pokémon, unique.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_0
TEXT: Hmm, I see... And then... Mm-hmm... Oh! Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_1
TEXT: I was totally absorbed in my investigation of a most curious phenomenon in the area. Maybe you’ve noticed it yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_2
TEXT: You know—the large boulders all over and the pieces of rock that look like they were broken off?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps you can help put some fire to all the smoke. Would you mind canvassing the area and letting me know if you find anything noteworthy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_0
TEXT: Aha! Looks like Bagon, the Rock Head Pokémon, is responsible for the recent rocky wreckage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_1
TEXT: Bagon aspire to one day soar through the sky. As if trying to dispel their frustration over their inability to do so, they slam their hard heads against huge rocks, shattering them into pebbles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_2
TEXT: In fact, there are some theories that suggest this head-bashing behavior stimulates cells that affect their evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_3
TEXT: Fascinating, isn’t it? Let’s test the theories out and evolve a Bagon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_0
TEXT: And what have we here, %PLAYERNAME%? Well, well, it’s Shelgon, the Endurance Pokémon! Excellent work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_1
TEXT: Shelgon’s shell is iron-hard and repels enemy attacks. When it’s waiting to evolve, it often hides away in a cavern.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_2
TEXT: And while it’s shut up in its shell, I hear it still dreams of the day it’ll be able to fly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_3
TEXT: Why don’t we give your Shelgon a helping hand to see what new heights—literally—it can reach?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_0
TEXT: Impressive! You helped Shelgon’s dreams come true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_1
TEXT: Salamence are overjoyed that they can finally take wing. They fly all over the place and usually don’t land until they’re completely exhausted and need to sleep.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_2
TEXT: I must say, this does open up all kinds of questions about what else Dragon-type Pokémon are capable of. It’s really inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_3
TEXT: And while I don’t recommend you bang your head into rocks to make your dreams come true, I’m sure the sky’s the limit for you too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_battle_weekend_1_0
TEXT: Where will you focus your efforts, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you happened to do any exploring today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_1
TEXT: It’s quite the sight, let me tell you! It’s lousy with Bellsprout out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_2
TEXT: They tend to prefer hot and humid places, but right now they seem to be everywhere.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_3
TEXT: And you know, there’s still plenty for us to learn about the Flower Pokémon. Would you be a pal and catch one for us to study?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. And what a great specimen you’ve brought!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that despite their slender frames, they can move lightning fast to catch insects? One more reason to be glad we’re not bugs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_2
TEXT: But there’s more for us to learn about this fascinating Pokémon! Drop by again after you’ve evolved your Bellsprout into Weepinbell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_3
TEXT: I’ll leaf through my Weepinbell research notes so I’m ready for you when you get back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_0
TEXT: Hey now, that’s got to be the Weepinbell of the ball! Let me take a closer look.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_1
TEXT: Aha! You see that large hook on its rear end? Weepinbell tend to use that to hook themselves on tree branches when they sleep.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_2
TEXT: In other words, if you see your Weepinbell yawning, find it a tree on the double!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_3
TEXT: But there’s no time for us to be snoozing. How about you evolve Weepinbell into a Victreebel and bring it back here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_0
TEXT: Hey, you’re victree-orious! Vic-tree...riffic? Ahem. Let’s have a look at your Victreebell, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_1
TEXT: These large, plant-like Pokémon live in huge colonies, deep within the jungle. No one who’s visited has returned to tell the tale. That’s sure foreboding!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_2
TEXT: Although if I put my professor cap on and think about it, how do we know about the colonies unless someone DID make it back?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_3
TEXT: There’s something to ponder! In the meantime, thanks for letting me observe your Victreebel. I’m sure you’ll be fast friends in no time—just watch out for that prey-dissolving acid!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pokémon, and I think you’re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: Let’s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pokémon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it’s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you’d pick Bidoof. Don’t ask me how!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata’s teeth, Bidoof’s teeth are continually growing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you’d pick the Plump Mouse Pokémon. Don’t ask me why!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pokémon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors—a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pokémon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_1
TEXT: Now—according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pokémon that has nerves of steel or a Pokémon that nests alongside water.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn’t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: You’re going with Bidoof, huh? I like your style, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Bidoof isn’t just cute to look at—it’s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: You choose Bidoof, eh? I never doubted it for a second.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof’s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow its banks, which is appreciated by people nearby. Fascinating, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pokémon—especially Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: Why don’t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_0
TEXT: Phase one, Razz Berry documentation: complete. Phase two, Pinap Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_1
TEXT: Ah. %PLAYERNAME%. My apologies—I didn’t see you there. I’ve been preoccupied with completing my latest research report.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_2
TEXT: Early findings are promising, and I’m eager to discuss the results with Professor Willow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_3
TEXT: But I must admit I’m having the slightest difficulty sourcing materials for the next step.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been so absorbed that I haven’t found a moment to shoo off the Team GO Rocket Grunts nearby. What’s more, they appear to have increased in number.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_5
TEXT: Nevertheless, these are my issues to resolve. What can I help you with today? It’s rare for you to stop by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_6
TEXT: Professor Willow suggested you check on me? Well, I appreciate the thought, but it’s quite unnecessary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_7
TEXT: Everything is under control here, so please, feel free to focus on your own studies. Now, where to source additional Berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_0
TEXT: Hm? I’m certain these Pinap Berries weren’t here earlier. And you’ve returned, %PLAYERNAME%? Then I suppose this was your doing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_1
TEXT: You didn’t need to trouble yourself, but this does take one thing off my to-do list. Curious about how I’ll use them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_2
TEXT: As you may know, my field of study includes Pokémon Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_3
TEXT: I’m currently investigating whether feeding a Pokémon various Berries immediately prior to it evolving has any influence on its physiology.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_4
TEXT: Speaking of which, the next step of this project is to see a Pokémon evolve. I’ll need to be on my way so I can locate one that’s ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_5
TEXT: Let’s continue our discussion another time, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_0
TEXT: Did it occur to you to evolve your Pokémon because of what I said earlier, %PLAYERNAME%? Thank you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_1
TEXT: You’ve saved me quite a bit of time. I now have just about everything I need to get back on track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_2
TEXT: The end goal of my research? To learn more about Pokémon, of course. There’s no end to that endeavor, as Professor Willow might say.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_3
TEXT: On a personal level, I’d be satisfied if my research led to more insight on Lapras.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_4
TEXT: Lapras are able to understand human speech and are very intelligent. Their intellect and good nature are why I have one as my partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_5
TEXT: Yet to the best of our knowledge, they do not evolve. I’d like to understand why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_6
TEXT: I’ve been working on hypotheses as to why some Pokémon are able to evolve while others are not, but that is a far longer-term project.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_7
TEXT: Perhaps I speak from a place of bias, but I think you’d do well to have a Lapras accompany you on your travels too, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_0
TEXT: I hope you and Lapras make all manner of discoveries together, %PLAYERNAME%—just like the discoveries you’ve helped me make today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your timely assistance, I can share my report far earlier than I initially anticipated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_2
TEXT: You’ve shown me today why Professor Willow always calls you his hero.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_3
TEXT: You’re an observant friend and Trainer who has a knack for sensing when others are in need, even if they don’t see it themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_4
TEXT: I suppose that makes you my hero too, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_0
TEXT: What a pleasure to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_1
TEXT: Go ahead and take a deep breath in! Smell that sweet scent wafting in the air?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_2
TEXT: There’s no deceiving a Pokémon Professor’s nose! That lovely aroma’s all the proof we need that the Grass-type Bounsweet must be nearby. And in great numbers, by the scent of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_3
TEXT: Now go on, follow your nose! Try and bring a Bounsweet back so we can study it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_0
TEXT: I’d recognize that smell of success a mile away, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve happened on a bounty of Bounsweet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_1
TEXT: Here’s a fact: we’re not the only ones interested in Bounsweet. Bird Pokémon are always after them, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_2
TEXT: One fact isn’t enough for you? Well, did you know that Bounsweet secrete a sweet—and delicious—sweat? Now you do! I sure wish I smelled that good!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. In any event, why don’t you head out and catch some more so we can keep our sweet new friends safe?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’re acquainted with the delightful Bounsweet, let’s familiarize ourselves with its Evolution, Steenee.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_2
TEXT: Keep a sharp eye out for a Steenee performing its signature twirl. When they spin like that, they’re spreading their amazing scent far and wide.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_3
TEXT: Just a whiff will give you a surge of happiness, in fact. So what are you waiting for, %PLAYERNAME%? We’ve got joy to...well, enjoy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_0
TEXT: Wow! What an impressive Tsareena!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_1
TEXT: But make sure you keep your guard up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_2
TEXT: Tsareena’s kick can hit hard enough to take out even the toughest kickboxing champ.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_3
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for all the assists today, %PLAYERNAME%. Stay sharp and keep well out of kicking distance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1
TEXT: Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2
TEXT: In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3
TEXT: It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4
TEXT: In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4
TEXT: That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5
TEXT: While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0
TEXT: Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1
TEXT: If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2
TEXT: Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3
TEXT: Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4
TEXT: They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1
TEXT: You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3
TEXT: In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4
TEXT: Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5
TEXT: Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_6
TEXT: There are so many things we can learn from Pokémon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today’s scientific excursion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_1
TEXT: I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_0
TEXT: Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_1
TEXT: Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_2
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_1
TEXT: Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_2
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_2
TEXT: I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_3
TEXT: Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_1
TEXT: Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_2
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_3
TEXT: I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_1
TEXT: Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_2
TEXT: I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_3
TEXT: While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_0
TEXT: This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_1
TEXT: While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_2
TEXT: I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_3
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_1
TEXT: You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was looking for.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_1
TEXT: So you’ve also noticed the sudden uptick in Chansey roaming around today. It’s rare to see so many of them—they’re usually quite elusive!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_2
TEXT: Did you know Chansey are said to bring happiness to any Trainer lucky enough to catch one?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps that’s why they’ve gathered—to bring us both an extra helping of happiness!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_4
TEXT: Say, why don’t you try befriending one? With Chansey by your side, I bet joyful things won’t be far behind!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. You seem happier already!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_1
TEXT: Have I mentioned that Chansey eggs are both rich in nutrients and extremely delicious? They’re considered quite the high-class ingredient in the culinary world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_2
TEXT: Chansey evolve from Happiny, the Playhouse Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_3
TEXT: Happiny love round white things and are known to carry egg-shaped rocks in imitation of Chansey. They’re much too small to lay their own eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_4
TEXT: If Happiny gets along well with someone, it will give them its rock. Tell me that isn’t the cutest thing you’ve ever heard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_5
TEXT: Like Happiny, Chansey can also evolve. Try evolving Chansey—and let me know when you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_0
TEXT: Excellent job, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_1
TEXT: Some say only Chansey that share a strong bond with their Trainer can evolve. If that’s true, you should be very proud!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_2
TEXT: Blissey, like Happiny and Chansey, is very kindhearted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_3
TEXT: Blissey senses sadness with its fluffy fur coat and will rush to the side of the forlorn—no matter how far away they may be—to share an egg of happiness.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_4
TEXT: Eating even one bite will bring a smile to any face.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_5
TEXT: I’m grinning at the thought! And it looks like your Blissey is equally excited to get back out there and spread more happiness. I’ll leave you to it and will see you again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_0
TEXT: What blissful buddies you two have become!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_1
TEXT: I’d say we’ve proven our earlier hypothesis—all these Chansey made today’s research an especially joyous job.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_2
TEXT: And now that we’re finished, I’m famished. It’s time for me to go encounter an omelet. See you later!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Watch your step, there are—ow—broken rocks all over today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been too occupied sweeping them up to find the cause, so I’m hoping you can help me figure out where they’ve come from. As with most odd occurrences, I suspect a Pokémon may be behind this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_2
TEXT: Speaking of odd occurrences, I saw a shooting star last night! There’ve been more and more of them lately—always beautiful sights. Maybe some of these rocks are bits of meteor!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_3
TEXT: Anyway, I won’t keep you, %PLAYERNAME%. Go see what Pokémon are out today, and think about which ones might be inclined to shatter rocks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Judging by the Pokémon you’ve caught, I’m guessing you think Chespin’s the cause of the broken rocks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_1
TEXT: You know what they say: “If the shell fits!” You know, when Chespin flex the quills on their heads, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_2
TEXT: Pretty impressive, considering that the quills are usually soft.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_3
TEXT: And speaking of the wooden shell on its head—that thing’s so thick that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn’t faze Chespin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_4
TEXT: Luckily for us, they’re good-natured Pokémon...even if they might have been having some fun with the local boulders. Help Chespin evolve and I’ll tell you more, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a strong-looking Quilladin, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_1
TEXT: See how the shape of its shell has changed? It relies on that sturdy shell to deflect predators’ attacks, and then counterattacks with sharp quills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_2
TEXT: Even so, they are very kind and won’t start fights.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_3
TEXT: It’s a quality that I imagine makes them ideal first partner Pokémon for Trainers starting out in the Kalos region—where Chespin, Quilladin, and Chesnaught were first discovered!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_4
TEXT: Speaking of Chesnaught, how about you help Quilladin evolve so we can observe one ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_0
TEXT: Now that is one fine-looking Chesnaught, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_1
TEXT: Those quills on its back are bigger than ever, and when it takes a defensive posture with its fists guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_2
TEXT: But just like Quilladin, this strapping Pokémon has a heart of gold. It will even shield its allies from danger with its own body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_3
TEXT: Now that’s what I call a reliable partner!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_4
TEXT: And I know you’ll look after Chesnaught in turn. That’s just the kind of Trainer you are, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for spending another exciting day researching Pokémon with me! I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, hi! It’s pretty hot out here, don’t you think? The heat must be coming from all the Cyndaquil running about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_1
TEXT: Are you familiar with it? It’s a Fire-type Pokémon known for its timid nature.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_2
TEXT: Since they scare easily, they’re usually found curled up in a little ball—and they’ll flare the flames on their backs to protect themselves when attacked!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you grab a pocket fan to stay cool and try to catch one of these fascinating Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_0
TEXT: That’s quite a Cyndaquil you’ve befriended, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re on fire—er, not literally, thankfully.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_1
TEXT: Let me reward you with some fun tidbits! Did you know that a Cyndaquil’s flames burn hottest when they’re startled?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_2
TEXT: And its Evolution, Quilava, will turn its back on opponents just to show off how ferociously its fire blazes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_3
TEXT: Let’s evolve your Cyndaquil into a Quilava. While I’m not jumping at the idea of making it even hotter around here, I AM eager to study the variance in flame intensity as they evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_0
TEXT: Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! Now, let’s take a closer look at your Quilava. You’re on a hot streak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_1
TEXT: As I mentioned, Quilava tend to use the heat of their flames to intimidate foes. Those flames burn even stronger when it prepares to fight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_2
TEXT: Your Quilava seems like a real firebrand! I bet it’ll be even more of a force to be reckoned with once it evolves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_3
TEXT: On that note, let’s turn the thermostat up to max—evolve your Quilava into Typhlosion! There’s learning to be had!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_0
TEXT: Oh! I was wondering why I was feeling so toasty, but now I see—you’re back with Typhlosion! Let’s take a moment to marvel at its raw power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_1
TEXT: When a Typhlosion’s rage peaks, it gets so hot that it’ll send anything that touches it up in flames!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_2
TEXT: I’m pretty sure my eyebrows are getting singed, but it’s totally worth it for an up-close encounter with such an awe-inspiring Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_3
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next adventure—stay cool!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I just developed this new type of Incense—Daily Adventure Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_1
TEXT: One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you’re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pokémon you’ve encountered before—even Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_2
TEXT: I’ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don’t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve come to the end of the year once again...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_1
TEXT: And it looks like some familiar Pokémon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_2
TEXT: Do you think they’re here to celebrate the year’s end with us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_3
TEXT: I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you’ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_4
TEXT: We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pokémon you’ve caught! Up for another challenge?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_1
TEXT: Will you evolve a few of them for me? I’d say you’ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_2
TEXT: What mischief it made this year—remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_3
TEXT: The bond between Trainer and Pokémon can change so much more than just a Pokémon’s appearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_4
TEXT: Just something to think about as you evolve your Pokémon today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_0
TEXT: With a new year just around the corner, I can’t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pokémon, and our fellow Trainers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_1
TEXT: That reminds me—have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we’re in for quite an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_2
TEXT: I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past—and our shared future...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_3
TEXT: Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pokémon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Poké Ball throws, too. Let’s end the year awash in new knowledge!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_0
TEXT: You’ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here’s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you’ve done for me this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_1
TEXT: I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you! I always feel a little nostalgic at the end of the year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_1
TEXT: So I thought we could look back on everything we’ve done over the last twelve months.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_2
TEXT: For starters, you’ve been putting that Daily Adventure Incense to great use... You’ve encountered Zorua and been caught up in Ditto's shenanigans...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_3
TEXT: And that’s just the beginning! Doesn’t remembering your accomplishments get you energized for more?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_4
TEXT: It does for me, and maybe Pokémon are feeling energized by the season too—look how many are out there today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_5
TEXT: I wonder if Pokémon perceive time like we do? Hmm... This could be a good topic for next year’s World Pokémon Ecological Society conference.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_6
TEXT: As for you, you should go for a stroll and think about all the amazing things you’ve done, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_0
TEXT: You’ve brought a jolly bunch of Pokémon with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_1
TEXT: Seeing all of them gets me thinking—remember how lucky we were to meet so many Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_2
TEXT: We even encountered all of the island guardians! I’d never seen them in person before—had you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_3
TEXT: It just goes to show that the more time we spend exploring the world, the more exciting sights we’ll see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_4
TEXT: What’s that? “Even if that sight’s on the other side of an Ultra Wormhole?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_5
TEXT: Ha ha! Very true, even if the experience was a little stressful. But I think it was worth it in the end, especially since we made a new friend—Rhi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_6
TEXT: Speaking of which, why don’t you pay Rhi a visit? In the meantime, please let me take a closer look at some of those Pokémon you’ve caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_0
TEXT: Seasonal greetings, %PLAYERNAME%.  Is this appropriate to say? I have only learned of “seasons” after coming to this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_1
TEXT: You have been busy today. What has occupied your attention?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_2
TEXT: Reminiscing with Professor Willow? I am told that is a fitting activity for this time of the...day?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_3
TEXT: No–year. I apologize. Tracking time by the sun’s passage is new to me, although I do find it fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_4
TEXT: My thoughts? Hm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_5
TEXT: As a member of the GO Ultra Recon Squad, I’ve journeyed through countless dimensions to learn more about the nature of Ultra Beasts and Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_6
TEXT: I can confidently say that a world as vibrant and radiant as yours is quite rare.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_7
TEXT: As rare as making a friend as kind as you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your aid has been invaluable, both in acclimating me to this world and in containing the Ultra Beasts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_8
TEXT: Our time together has been well-spent, from my perspective. If you are amenable, I would enjoy continuing our collaboration. Are you free right now?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_9
TEXT: I would like to observe as you catch some Pokémon. Your accuracy is remarkable, and I suspect I could learn something watching you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_1
TEXT: That’s another day of research done. Thank you for choosing to spend it with me—and with Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_2
TEXT: This year has had its challenges, as they all do. But no matter what obstacles we face, I know I can rely on you to help overcome them...and that thought always brightens my day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_3
TEXT: I hope that the time you’ve spent with me and with Pokémon has also been a source of joy, because you yourself bring joy to so many.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_4
TEXT: In fact, if I could make a wish right now, it’d be for our next year to be just as amazing as this one. And with you around, hey—I’m sure it will be. See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe we’re already approaching the year’s end?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_1
TEXT: But what a year it’s been! Rife with surprises, discoveries—and so many Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_2
TEXT: In fact, I think I saw some familiar Pokémon while I was out walking earlier. Perhaps they’ve gathered to celebrate with us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you get out there and try to catch a few?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_0
TEXT: We’ve certainly crossed paths with some fascinating Pokémon this past year, haven’t we, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_1
TEXT: I’ll never forget the moment I finally witnessed Kecleon’s masterful camouflage firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_2
TEXT: And how about when we encountered all those Pokémon first discovered in the Paldea region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_3
TEXT: Watching those Bombirdier soaring overhead was a thrill and a half!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_4
TEXT: Which Pokémon were you most excited to encounter this year, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_5
TEXT: Who knows—the best may still be yet to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_1
TEXT: I was just reminiscing about all the ways we’ve connected with fellow Trainers this past year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_2
TEXT: From showcasing our favorite Pokémon to partying up with friends and taking on challenges together, it feels like our community has never been more connected.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_3
TEXT: Do you ever stop while exploring a Route to think about all the other Trainers who’ve walked that same path? All the incredible adventures they’ve had and the ones they have ahead?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_4
TEXT: As we explore today, let’s appreciate the wonderful community we’re part of and the friends we’ve made this year. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_0
TEXT: Nice work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_1
TEXT: You should be incredibly proud of what you’ve achieved this year. I know I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_2
TEXT: And yet, something tells me you’re only getting started.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_3
TEXT: Wherever our journey takes us next, I’m grateful to be by your side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_4
TEXT: But enough about the future. Let’s get back out there and enjoy the present!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_1
TEXT: It’s almost as if Pokémon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_2
TEXT: Strangely enough, the Pokémon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_3
TEXT: Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We’ve had quite a year, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_4
TEXT: As you venture out to catch these Pokémon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you’ve grown as a Pokémon Trainer along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_5
TEXT: Who knows—you might even surprise yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_0
TEXT: Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_1
TEXT: As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we’ve accomplished together this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_2
TEXT: We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_3
TEXT: We even encountered Legendary Pokémon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_4
TEXT: Then there were the Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch’d!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_5
TEXT: Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_6
TEXT: Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough. It’s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_0
TEXT: Ah—Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_1
TEXT: Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_2
TEXT: OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry—I couldn’t help it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_3
TEXT: You know, Gastly isn’t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_4
TEXT: That’s right—I’m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_5
TEXT: You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren’t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_6
TEXT: I hope that world comes to be someday.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_7
TEXT: Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_8
TEXT: Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_0
TEXT: It’s certainly been an interesting year, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can’t remember another one like it, and I’ve seen a few!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_1
TEXT: But despite all the ways it’s challenged us, I can’t help but think that it’ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_2
TEXT: After all, no matter what happens, we’re all on this Pokémon journey together—every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_3
TEXT: That’s truly something special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_4
TEXT: So when the going gets tough, remember that you’re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_5
TEXT: I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_6
TEXT: The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn’t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_7
TEXT: And as the mysterious world of Pokémon continues to grow, so do we—as Trainers, as a community, and as people.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_8
TEXT: So here’s to a year for the books—and many more exciting ones to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_0
TEXT: It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_1
TEXT: Ah! Greetings again, Pokémon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pokémon are present today—Deino, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_2
TEXT: Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand—but do not fret. The pain was minimal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_3
TEXT: This world is replete with unique Pokémon. Though I wish to study them all, today’s focus will be on Deino alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_4
TEXT: May I borrow some moments from you, Pokémon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_1
TEXT: Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_2
TEXT: ......

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_4
TEXT: I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pokémon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_5
TEXT: I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_0
TEXT: How dee, Pokémon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah—stickers. What is the function of these adornments?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_1
TEXT: I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pokémon Trainers in this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_2
TEXT: Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pokémon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_3
TEXT: Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pokémon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_4
TEXT: If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino’s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_0
TEXT: Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_1
TEXT: I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous—though I cannot discern if either head can see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_2
TEXT: The two heads appear quite quarrelsome—particularly regarding food. Ah—be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_3
TEXT: Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_4
TEXT: I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pokémon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_5
TEXT: Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_6
TEXT: I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here—but the Pokémon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Say, have you observed anything strange on your travels lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been getting reports of a mysterious energy gathering around the world. This seems different than anything we’ve seen before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_2
TEXT: I’m eager to figure out what’s going on. Are you up for a little exploration?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_3
TEXT: Take a look around the area and let me know what you find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_0
TEXT: Good Graveler, that Wooloo is massive!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_1
TEXT: This must be a Dynamax Pokémon! Just imagine how much fabric you could make with all that wool. Let me know if you give it a spin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_2
TEXT: Ahem. Dynamax Pokémon have powerful techniques called Max Moves that can be enhanced with Max Particles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you start collecting Max Particles while I research these moves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_0
TEXT: Check out that enhanced Max Move! I wouldn't expect any less from a Trainer such as yourself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_1
TEXT: And have you noticed the Dynamax Pokémon appearing at Power Spots, those incredible energy sources you encountered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_2
TEXT: This is a great opportunity to observe your Dynamax Wooloo in action.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_3
TEXT: You can test its Max Moves against another Dynamax Pokémon. Give it a GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%, great timing! Fancy doing a little investigation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_1
TEXT: All these Ultra Wormholes we’ve encountered lately have got me thinking. Ultra Space is fascinating, sure, but there are places closer to home that still beg to be explored—like the fabled island of Dragonite!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_2
TEXT: Have you heard the tale?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_3
TEXT: Once, a Dragonite saved a shipwrecked man, taking him to a remote island—a paradise occupied solely by Dragonite. Doesn’t that sound like something, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_4
TEXT: Imagine the unique ecosystem that island would have! It’d be a veritable treasure trove for scientific inquiry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_5
TEXT: Questions are already rattling around in my head: what do Dragonite use their horns for? How quickly can they move in water? What kind of Berries do they—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_6
TEXT: Whoops. I’m getting ahead of myself. First, we need to do some baseline research on the Pokémon in question.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_7
TEXT: We might even find some clues about this Dragonite paradise!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_8
TEXT: Let’s start by observing Dratini, which can evolve into Dragonair and then Dragonite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_0
TEXT: Whoa! Look at how many Dratini you’ve caught, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that in the past, Dratini was so rarely glimpsed that some called it the “Mirage Pokémon”?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_2
TEXT: And yet here you are with a whole host of them. They seem real enough to me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_3
TEXT: You know, I read a report recently that a small colony of Dratini was found living underwater.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_4
TEXT: That would suggest that Dratini and its Evolutions like to live in groups.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_5
TEXT: And if that’s true...then the island of Dragonite could be real after all! First, though, we should learn more about Dratini’s Evolution, Dragonair.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_6
TEXT: Think you can find one, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_0
TEXT: What a majestic Dragonair, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_1
TEXT: Dragonair’s mystical appearance always leaves me in awe. In fact, this Pokémon is known for its gentle aura.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_2
TEXT: Some even call it divine! And for good reason—see the crystalline globes on its head and tail? Dragonair can use them to freely control the weather.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_3
TEXT: I bet that’d come in useful if you had, say, an island full of Dragonite that you wanted to keep hidden. Or if you were constantly forgetting your research notes outside on rainy days...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_4
TEXT: But that’s a me problem. Next, let’s help Dragonair evolve into the star of today’s studies—Dragonite!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_1
TEXT: Just like Dratini and Dragonair, Dragonite is an extremely rarely seen Pokémon. How lucky we are that we can study one today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_2
TEXT: Dragonite is known as “the sea incarnate.” Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it’s satisfied.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_3
TEXT: Luckily for us, it’s typically a kindhearted Pokémon. If it spots a drowning person or Pokémon, Dragonite simply must help them—like that shipwrecked man I mentioned earlier today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_4
TEXT: Why don’t we set sail and get looking for that island? Dragonite’ll surely bail us out if things go sideways!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_5
TEXT: I’m joking, I’m joking. Thanks for humoring me today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_6
TEXT: Even without weighing anchor, we learned more about Pokémon and found new ways to look at facts we already knew. I’d say that’s time well spent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_7
TEXT: Though to be fair, I’d say that about any time we spend together. Heh. I’ll be in touch again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you noticed an increase in Ghost-type Pokémon appearing lately? Because I sure have.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_1
TEXT: I was conducting some research in my lab recently when I felt a chill run up my spine—almost like something was watching me from the shadows.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_2
TEXT: I whirled around to face my uninvited guest and saw a Pokémon floating eerily in the corner! Apparently startled by my gaze, it flew through the wall and escaped into the great outdoors. I haven’t seen it since.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_3
TEXT: Based on my brief glimpse of it and its quick escape, I believe my visitor was Duskull, the Requiem Pokémon. It’s known to silently sneak up on its prey by making itself invisible. It also has the ability to slip straight through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_4
TEXT: Naturally, my goal now is to learn more about Duskull. Can you lend me a hand? Hopefully we can come to understand why it was sneaking around my lab!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work researching Duskull. While you were out, I actually had another eerie encounter in my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_1
TEXT: I saw Duskull slipping through a wall to scare me again, so I shouted, “BOO!” before it could and turned the tables. It fled back through the wall—but then it reappeared and looked at me expectantly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_2
TEXT: Thus began an impromptu game of peek-a-boo! It made me realize that Duskull may not get many chances to play with others because people are so quick to startle at its appearance. Makes you a bit sad, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_3
TEXT: I wonder what else we can learn about Duskull. I know: Why don’t you try evolving your Duskull into Dusclops? Also known as the Beckon Pokémon, Dusclops apparently sucks everything in as if it were a black hole—so be careful of its mouth!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_0
TEXT: Wait, %PLAYERNAME%, you did WHAT? I was so sure I told you NOT to feed a Berry to Dusclops... But maybe I said the opposite by mistake? Yeah, my bad on that one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_1
TEXT: But it just ate the Berry normally, huh? No danger of you getting sucked in as well? Fascinating... O-oh, and, er, quite relieving! Yes, glad to see you back in one piece.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_2
TEXT: Now, let’s learn more about Dusclops’s Evolution, Dusknoir. Known as the Gripper Pokémon, it’s said to steal people and Pokémon away at the behest of transmissions from the spirit world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_3
TEXT: No one knows whether Dusknoir has a will of its own. Sounds like a Pokémon ripe for researching! Could you evolve your Dusclops for me so we can learn more?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_0
TEXT: Hey there, Trai— AAAH! G-G-G-GHOST! Behind you! It’s— Wait. Is that Dusknoir? Hah, sorry about that. It’s my first time seeing one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_1
TEXT: No matter how spooky they may seem, we have to remember that Ghost-type Pokémon are Pokémon all the same. They’re looking for friends just like the rest of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_2
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope to see you and your Dusknoir again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_1
TEXT: Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2
TEXT: Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution lies within Eevee’s genetics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_3
TEXT: I can understand that hypothesis—after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_4
TEXT: I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_5
TEXT: I don’t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time—even to formal events!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, perhaps by researching Eevee, we’ll unravel even more mysteries of Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to get started! Let’s GO learn about Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0
TEXT: Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1
TEXT: According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2
TEXT: For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4
TEXT: As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1
TEXT: These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2
TEXT: Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3
TEXT: Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4
TEXT: And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7
TEXT: Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8
TEXT: If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_1
TEXT: The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2
TEXT: As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3
TEXT: Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4
TEXT: It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5
TEXT: Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6
TEXT: The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7
TEXT: Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1
TEXT: I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2
TEXT: The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3
TEXT: We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4
TEXT: Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5
TEXT: I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6
TEXT: But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7
TEXT: This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8
TEXT: I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_electric_rd_mar24_1_0
TEXT: Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve got all sorts of Pokémon to catch—and plenty of research that needs doing—ahead of us. I can’t wait to get started!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_electric_rd_mar24_1_1
TEXT: Which of these Pokémon are you looking forward to encountering the most?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_0
TEXT: *yawn*

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_1
TEXT: Oh, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry you caught me mid-yawn. I was up late reading the newest Pokémon Researcher’s Weekly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_2
TEXT: There was a fascinating article about Fennekin, and coincidentally, they’re all over the place today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_3
TEXT: Did you know Fennekin are filled with energy after eating twigs? If that worked for me, I would’ve made myself a plate of scrumptious sticks to get through my reading last night.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_4
TEXT: But why read about Fennekin when we can make our own observations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_5
TEXT: What kind of twigs do Fennekin prefer? Do you think each Fennekin has a unique preference?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_6
TEXT: Think on those questions while you observe the Fennekin in the area, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_1
TEXT: Have you gathered any promising information? I see you’ve at least gathered some promising Fennekin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_2
TEXT: They sure are cute and fluffy, but I’d be careful about getting too close. Their roomy ears vent blistering hot air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_3
TEXT: Hmm... These fine Fennekin don’t look like they have any twigs on them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_4
TEXT: Maybe we’ll get a better view of some sprigs with Fennekin’s Evolution, Braixen. Instead of snacking on twigs, they stick them in their tails.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_5
TEXT: If you’re curious why, bring one by and I’ll tell you all about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_0
TEXT: What a beautiful Braixen, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_1
TEXT: I’ll tell you about that twig, as promised.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_2
TEXT: When the twig is plucked from its tail, friction sets it alight. It uses the flame to send signals to its allies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_3
TEXT: What do you suppose Braixen communicate about? Maybe where to find the most energizing stick snacks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_4
TEXT: These Pokémon’s cleverness with tools doesn’t stop there. Braixen’s Evolution, Delphox, can use branches to see into the future.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_5
TEXT: I’m no Delphox, but I sure see a Delphox in your future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_0
TEXT: Looks like my prediction came true, %PLAYERNAME%! That Delphox of yours is downright delightful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_1
TEXT: Delphox gaze into the flame at the tip of their branches to achieve a focused state, allowing them to see into the future.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_2
TEXT: And when they use their psychic power, they can generate a fiery vortex, incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_3
TEXT: It’s a wonder their branches don’t catch fire! Could Delphox be using their psychic powers to protect their branches?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_4
TEXT: If you continue observing your Delphox, perhaps you’ll find the answer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_5
TEXT: But until then, thanks for spending another day researching with me. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_1
TEXT: Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_2
TEXT: I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_3
TEXT: Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_4
TEXT: A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_2
TEXT: I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_5
TEXT: It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_6
TEXT: When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_0
TEXT: That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_1
TEXT: Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_2
TEXT: You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_3
TEXT: Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_4
TEXT: Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_5
TEXT: With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_6
TEXT: Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_1
TEXT: I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_2
TEXT: Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_3
TEXT: Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_4
TEXT: Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flock_together_rd_may24_1_0
TEXT: Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve got all sorts of Pokémon to catch and research that needs doing. I can’t wait to get started!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flock_together_rd_may24_1_1
TEXT: Which of these fine feathered friends are you hoping to spot?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of being seen, I’ve been getting the feeling that something’s watching me while I’ve been out walking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_2
TEXT: I’m fairly certain my mystery observer is a Pokémon, but I haven’t the froggiest what it could be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_3
TEXT: I suppose there’s only one way to know for sure...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_4
TEXT: Let’s hop to it, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_1
TEXT: Your investigation went better than I could have possibly hopped. What a delight to see Froakie up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_2
TEXT: Froakie secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take from attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_3
TEXT: If you think that’s cool, just wait till you see Froakie’s Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_4
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Froakie for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_0
TEXT: Nice job, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_1
TEXT: Frogadier’s swiftness is unparalleled. It can scale a tower of more than 2,000 feet in only a minute!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_2
TEXT: On top of that, Frogadier can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control. Quite the skill set, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_3
TEXT: I tend to associate bubbles with baths, personally—I never would have thought to use them to cover pebbles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_4
TEXT: Frogadier’s pretty impressive, but I’ve heard its Evolution is even more so.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_5
TEXT: Will you help me study it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_6
TEXT: Let’s put a spring in our step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_0
TEXT: Wow—you made quick work of that, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_1
TEXT: Greninja can create throwing stars out of compressed water. When it throws them at high speed, they can even split metal in half!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_2
TEXT: Quite the upgrade from Frogadier’s bubble-coated pebbles, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for helping me learn more about Froakie and its Evolutions, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_4
TEXT: Between Greninja’s grace and your skills as a Trainer, I’m sure the two of you can overcome any obstacle. Maybe even split it in two! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_5
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1
TEXT: You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2
TEXT: A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3
TEXT: At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4
TEXT: For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1
TEXT: I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2
TEXT: That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3
TEXT: As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4
TEXT: I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5
TEXT: I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6
TEXT: Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0
TEXT: ... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1
TEXT: Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2
TEXT: Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3
TEXT: I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4
TEXT: Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5
TEXT: While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1
TEXT: Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3
TEXT: I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0
TEXT: What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1
TEXT: I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2
TEXT: This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1
TEXT: I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2
TEXT: Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3
TEXT: Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4
TEXT: I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5
TEXT: I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1
TEXT: While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2
TEXT: I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3
TEXT: Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4
TEXT: We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5
TEXT: When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0
TEXT: Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1
TEXT: Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2
TEXT: It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3
TEXT: What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4
TEXT: We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0
TEXT: Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1
TEXT: Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2
TEXT: Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3
TEXT: I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4
TEXT: And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1
TEXT: I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2
TEXT: We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3
TEXT: Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4
TEXT: First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_5
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_0
TEXT: Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1
TEXT: I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2
TEXT: Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3
TEXT: The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4
TEXT: Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5
TEXT: Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0
TEXT: Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_1
TEXT: However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2
TEXT: I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3
TEXT: This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4
TEXT: Let's do the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0
TEXT: Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1
TEXT: I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2
TEXT: Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3
TEXT: It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4
TEXT: The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5
TEXT: These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6
TEXT: If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7
TEXT: Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8
TEXT: Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!
{0}
{1}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0
TEXT: That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1
TEXT: It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2
TEXT: I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4
TEXT: This weekend will be one to remember!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_0
TEXT: Oh! Hi, %PLAYERNAME%! Don’t mind the mess...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_1
TEXT: I was just enjoying the shade and jotting down a few notes when I noticed some slime on my coat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_2
TEXT: Research opportunities come in unexpected forms, and I have an inkling this residue belongs to a certain clingy culprit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_3
TEXT: While I figure out how to clean this up, could you look around and let me know if you observe anything interesting in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_0
TEXT: Aha! I knew it! This goo came from Goomy, the Soft Tissue Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_1
TEXT: Goomy tend to live in damp, shady places so their bodies don’t dry out. I should’ve watched where I was sitting!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to learn more about Goomy and its Evolutions while we have this opportunity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_3
TEXT: Given that you seem better than me at staying slime-free, would you mind evolving Goomy into Sliggoo?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_0
TEXT: You’re a slime savant, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_1
TEXT: But take extra care around your new Sliggoo. Its mucus can dissolve pretty much anything.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_2
TEXT: Also, I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s worth mentioning that Sliggoo are known to have trouble drawing a line between friends and food.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_3
TEXT: Might be worth seeing if yours is ready to evolve. It could save you the trouble of fending off a well-intentioned but melty hug!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_0
TEXT: Simply slime-tastic, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_1
TEXT: Goodra is an amazingly friendly Pokémon with a penchant for hugging its Trainer. And yes, before you ask—that can make things pretty gooey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_2
TEXT: This Pokémon isn’t all slime and rainbows though. The strikes from Goodra’s horns land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_3
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for sticking with this research! I hope you and your Goodra stay together for many years to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_1
TEXT: I take it you’ve noticed the influx of Grubbin in the area today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_2
TEXT: These Pokémon spit sticky threads to stop opponents in their tracks—so you’d be wise to stay on their good side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_3
TEXT: Grubbin generally live underground, though... I wonder what’s lured them to the surface today. Can you catch a few to investigate?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_4
TEXT: Perhaps it’s simply strength in numbers. Grubbin’s natural enemies sometimes prefer fleeing over risking a run-in with the Larva Pokémon’s powerful mandibles—or worse, an unexpected shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you discovered why so many Grubbin have appeared above ground today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_5
TEXT: I’ve also heard Grubbin loves snacking on sweet tree sap. Do you think it tastes anything like Pinap Berry juice?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_6
TEXT: Maybe I’d better try some myself... Y-you know, for science!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_7
TEXT: Ahem. Grubbin is certainly a fascinating Pokémon, but just wait till you see its Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_8
TEXT: Why don’t you go ahead and evolve a Grubbin yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_0
TEXT: Nice Charjabug, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_1
TEXT: Charjabug can store electricity in its body to use later. Apparently it’s a popular companion on camping trips!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_2
TEXT: It also like to bury itself in fallen leaves and munch away on the rich topsoil beneath.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_3
TEXT: Tread carefully out there, %PLAYERNAME%—you and Charjabug might be equally shocked if you step on one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_4
TEXT: Nobody likes to be interrupted while they’re lost in the feed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, you’re sure to be impressed by Charjabug’s electric power. Its mandibles may be smaller than Grubbin’s, but don’t let that fool you into thinking it’s a pushover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_6
TEXT: You know, Charjabug can evolve too. I’ve never witnessed its Evolution myself, but I’ve heard it’s quite a sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_7
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Charjabug, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_0
TEXT: Wow—it’s Vikavolt!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_1
TEXT: Who would have thought that a little Grubbin would eventually evolve into this stunning, winged creature?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_2
TEXT: Vikavolt builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_3
TEXT: They’ve also been known to carry Charjabug to use as spare batteries, allowing Vikavolt to rapidly fire off fully powered attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_4
TEXT: It sounds a bit intimidating, but it’s also a lovely example of two Pokémon working in tandem. Inspiring stuff, if you ask me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_5
TEXT: Who knows—maybe your Vikavolt will act as a battery of sorts and keep YOU charged up while adventuring together! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1
TEXT: While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2
TEXT: Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3
TEXT: However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1
TEXT: I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2
TEXT: Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3
TEXT: I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1
TEXT: It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2
TEXT: I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1
TEXT: If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2
TEXT: Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3
TEXT: BOO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4
TEXT: Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_0
TEXT: OoOoOo... There’s a chill in the air... Can you feel it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_1
TEXT: Seems like I’ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pokémon we’ve been seeing somehow involved?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_2
TEXT: Either way, I think we’re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we’ll face it together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_3
TEXT: Speaking of faces, I’ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pokémon, so it seems like now’s the time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_5
TEXT: Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_0
TEXT: Ah—a Yamask AND a Duskull!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_1
TEXT: I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_2
TEXT: It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pokémon by its...well, skull, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_3
TEXT: Now, about that Yamask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Spirit Pokémon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_5
TEXT: A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_6
TEXT: What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_7
TEXT: Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_8
TEXT: Perhaps you’ll come across one while you’re out conducting research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_9
TEXT: I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_0
TEXT: Wow, a Galarian Yamask!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_1
TEXT: Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_2
TEXT: It’s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_3
TEXT: Oh, and you’ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pokémon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to be that kid, that’s for sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_5
TEXT: Between Galarian Yamask’s slab, Banette’s puppet body, and all the Pokémon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor’s turned way up at the moment!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_6
TEXT: Even so, I’d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_7
TEXT: Come on, Trainer—let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_0
TEXT: Looks like we’re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_2
TEXT: In fact, Cubone—which evolves into Marowak—is even said to wear the skull of its mother.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_3
TEXT: When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother’s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_4
TEXT: Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we’ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_5
TEXT: Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pokémon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won’t stop me from continuing to try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_6
TEXT: After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I’m studying Pokémon. You know what I mean?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_7
TEXT: Anyway, I think we’re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. It is fortunate you’ve arrived.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_1
TEXT: I just observed a curious sight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_2
TEXT: Floating over there were vaguely human visages, and carved slabs of...clay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_3
TEXT: Yet despite the differences between these apparitions, they had a similar air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_4
TEXT: As with many mysterious things in this world, I suspect Pokémon to be behind this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_5
TEXT: Assuming I am correct, I wish to catch them. Then perhaps Professor Willow can share his insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_0
TEXT: Where’s that old getup of mine—oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been thinking of what to wear to Spark’s upcoming costume party. A Litwick hat? A Pikachu onesie? I can’t have Candela outshine me again this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_2
TEXT: Speaking of masquerades—is that a Yamask AND a Galarian Yamask? I can’t disguise my excitement!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_3
TEXT: You know, they say Yamask carry masks that used to be their faces when they were human. Sometimes they look at them and cry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_4
TEXT: And Galarian Yamask are supposedly formed when ancient clay tablets are drawn to vengeful spirits.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_5
TEXT: Somber origins, but don’t they set your curiosity ablaze? I wonder how Yamask feel now that they’ve become Pokémon. What sort of thoughts are running through their minds?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_6
TEXT: In the “spirit” of inquiry, why don’t you see what other Ghost-type Pokémon you can find? You might even come across more Yamask!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_0
TEXT: Professor Willow is certainly knowledgeable. We were right to seek his wisdom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_1
TEXT: To think that Yamask and Galarian Yamask have such origins... Incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_2
TEXT: I must thank you for catching them. With every day we spend together, I learn something new.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_3
TEXT: The Pokémon we’ve seen of late have been...dark, in a manner of speaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_4
TEXT: But as the Professor said, they are simply another mystery we researchers can illuminate with our findings. Fear need not be a component of exploring the unknown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_5
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I shall continue observing these Yamask as I ponder today’s events.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps you could investigate other Ghost-type Pokémon in the meantime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_7
TEXT: And to repay Professor Willow, I could see if I possess a GO Ultra Recon Squad uniform in his size...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. I’ve just about finished my Yamask, erm, mask, inspired by you and Rhi! What’ve the two of you been up to?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_1
TEXT: Whoa, you’ve caught even more Ghost-type Pokémon! It’s starting to look like a haunted house around here—or a haunted lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_2
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon always remind me how much remains in the world for us to uncover. Where do Drifloon drift off to? Do Duskull really spirit away bad children? What powers a Golett?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_3
TEXT: With enough time and perseverance, I’m sure we researchers will find the answers to these questions and more. Or maybe they’ll be answered by an up-and-at-’em Trainer like you! When it comes to learning, jump in headfirst, I always say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_4
TEXT: Though...maybe I should amend that motto to exclude Ultra Wormholes. Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for the extra motivation today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1
TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we’ve had, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_1
TEXT: How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_2
TEXT: I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_3
TEXT: While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_4
TEXT: I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn’t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_5
TEXT: As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_6
TEXT: There was a note attached. I’ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here’s what I’ve got so far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_7
TEXT: “Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_10
TEXT: Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful—but I think you can handle it, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_11
TEXT: It’s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we’ve finally reached the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_12
TEXT: It’s almost bittersweet, don’t you think? But fret not—I’m sure more discoveries await!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_13
TEXT: Let’s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries—you, me, and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_8
TEXT: Of course, this is all just a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_9
TEXT: We’ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_1
TEXT: I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You’d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_2
TEXT: I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pokémon, don’t you agree?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_3
TEXT: It’s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_4
TEXT: Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let’s see about catching a few to find out more about them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_0
TEXT: Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_1
TEXT: They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_2
TEXT: Hoppip can also evolve, and it’s quite the sight. Don’t take my word for it—how about you go see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_0
TEXT: What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_1
TEXT: The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn’t that fascinating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_2
TEXT: In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don’t blame it—if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_3
TEXT: Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don’t you evolve one, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_1
TEXT: Wouldn’t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_2
TEXT: On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll—maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_3
TEXT: See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_0
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_1
TEXT: James: What is it, Jessie?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_2
TEXT: Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_3
TEXT: James: Go on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_4
TEXT: Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_5
TEXT: James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_6
TEXT: Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_7
TEXT: James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_8
TEXT: Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_9
TEXT: James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_0
TEXT: Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_1
TEXT: James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_2
TEXT: Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_3
TEXT: James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_4
TEXT: James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_0
TEXT: Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_1
TEXT: James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_10
TEXT: James: Hey, who exactly are you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_11
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_12
TEXT: Jessie: You’d better start talking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_13
TEXT: Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_14
TEXT: James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_15
TEXT: Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_16
TEXT: James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_17
TEXT: Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_18
TEXT: Jessie: Prepare for trouble...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_19
TEXT: James: And make it double!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_2
TEXT: Jessie: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_20
TEXT: Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_21
TEXT: James: To unite all people— HEY! Are you even listening?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_3
TEXT: James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_4
TEXT: James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_5
TEXT: Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_6
TEXT: James: Well, no one told me, either!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_7
TEXT: Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_8
TEXT: James: I said no such thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_9
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_0
TEXT: Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_1
TEXT: James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_2
TEXT: James: Huh?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_3
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_4
TEXT: James: Drat! That Pokémon was supposed to be ours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_5
TEXT: Jessie: Mark our words...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_6
TEXT: James: We’ll get you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_7
TEXT: Jessie: We’re blasting off again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_1
TEXT: I have an exciting discovery to share with you today. Have you heard of the Legendary Pokémon Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like they’ve been challenging Trainers in Raid Battles recently!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_3
TEXT: Coming face-to-face with any Legendary Pokémon is cause to celebrate, but I’m extra intrigued this time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_4
TEXT: Why, you ask? Well, Spark said he saw something peculiar along the waterfront while he was taking pictures earlier—a Pokémon running across the water’s surface!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_5
TEXT: But the photos he captured are, ah... Let’s just say it’s hard to tell what exactly is in them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_6
TEXT: Do you think this could be connected to the appearance of those Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_7
TEXT: This calls for more research. How about you document your findings with some GO Snapshots? We might be on the trail of something extraordinary!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your research will help us dive a bit deeper into what’s currently going on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_1
TEXT: Since the Legendary Pokémon we discussed previously have been testing Trainers’ skills in raids, I consulted with Candela, the authority on all things related to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_2
TEXT: She thinks the current situation points to the Colt Pokémon, Keldeo, making an appearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_3
TEXT: Candela is a bona fide expert on Keldeo, you see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_4
TEXT: She said that Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion taught this Pokémon how to fight and that it dashes across the world, seeking opportunities to further its training.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_5
TEXT: No wonder Candela is such a big fan! It’s clear that Keldeo has the drive to improve itself and the passion to accomplish whatever it sets its mind to doing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_6
TEXT: Why don’t we take some inspiration from Keldeo and do some training? With such a battle-hardened Pokémon around, we can’t be too prepared.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_1
TEXT: While you were battling away, Blanche and I had a moment to dig into some texts and learn more about Keldeo.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_2
TEXT: Evidently, Keldeo is considered part of a powerful group of Pokémon from the Unova region that includes Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_3
TEXT: This confirms a link between their appearance and Spark’s sighting near the waterfront.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_4
TEXT: It’s said that Keldeo must survive harsh battles and fully develop the horn on its forehead before its true power will awaken.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_5
TEXT: Hm. I wonder what this “true power” might be. Let’s investigate the relationship between power and Pokémon by...well, powering up and evolving some Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_0
TEXT: It’s all starting to come together. I think it’s now safe to say our mysterious visitor is indeed the Mythical Pokémon Keldeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_1
TEXT: Blanche and I found more information, too. For starters, Keldeo actually has two forms, one of which is called its “Ordinary Form.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, Keldeo can glide across water by blasting water from its hooves—and it excels at using leg moves while battling!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_3
TEXT: This corroborates both Spark’s sighting and Candela’s knowledge of this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_4
TEXT: I think I’ll contact them and propose a trip to the waterfront to see if we can gather more information firsthand. Stay tuned!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_0
TEXT: That was quite the field trip, %PLAYERNAME%, but I bear good news!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I came across fresh Keldeo tracks near the waterfall in Spark’s picture!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_2
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela all wanted to the be first to meet the Mythical Pokémon, so they’re battling it out to decide who gets the honor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_3
TEXT: And then there’s you. Given what a great Pokémon Trainer you are, I reckon you and Keldeo could achieve some truly marvelous feats together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_4
TEXT: Not to undermine our friends, but why don’t you head out with your buddy to see if you can encounter it first?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_0
TEXT: Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught the Mythical Pokémon Keldeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_1
TEXT: What an incredible discovery. Thank you for all your help as we followed those clues to their extraordinary end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_2
TEXT: Whoa! I can feel Keldeo’s determination to train from here. This Pokémon’s full of drive, just like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_3
TEXT: Don’t keep it waiting—feel free to give yourselves a workout by taking Keldeo to battle other Trainers!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I can tell that Keldeo enjoyed getting stronger with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I are so proud of all the work you’re doing to grow as a Trainer. This only adds to the list of your accomplishments.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_2
TEXT: And with enough time and training, perhaps we’ll be able to see Keldeo’s other form one day. I’ll keep a blank page in my research notebook ready—no, several pages!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_3
TEXT: Haha. I suppose that marks the end of this adventure, but you’ll be hearing from me soon, %PLAYERNAME%. Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Impeccable timing. I was getting ready to go look for you. There’s something I’d like your help investigating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_1
TEXT: This morning, Meltan and I were taking a walk along one of our favorite routes when I noticed that a hill we always pass by seemed...smaller than usual.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_2
TEXT: There’s only one possibility—Team GO Rocket’s started LITERALLY moving mountains to get their hands on Pokémon! Those scoundrels!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_3
TEXT: Well, whatever they’re scheming, I’m sure it’s nothing you can’t nip in the bud. Good luck out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_4
TEXT: ... ... ...
Haha! I’m only pulling your leg. In truth, I suspect a Pokémon is responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_5
TEXT: Take a look around and see if you spot a Pokémon that could be our mountain-moving culprit, would you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_1
TEXT: Judging from the Pokémon with you, it looks like our mountain-mover must be Larvitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_2
TEXT: This intrepid Pokémon is born deep underground.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_3
TEXT: To come up to the surface, it needs to eat its way through the soil above. It can’t see its parents’ faces until it does.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_4
TEXT: That’s hard work for a newborn, but its tough spirit’s something to admire.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_5
TEXT: I’ll bet that spirit endures in its evolved form, Pupitar. Let’s observe one ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_0
TEXT: Whoa! I thought I saw something shooting past, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_1
TEXT: Maybe it was another of those shooting stars I keep seeing...but maybe it was your Pupitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_2
TEXT: Pupitar can’t wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas—almost like a rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_3
TEXT: Plus, its shell is as hard as sheet rock. Its thrashing can topple a mountain, believe it or not!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_4
TEXT: Some think of Pupitar as a troublesome Pokémon, but I can relate to its desire to grow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_5
TEXT: I know sometimes I’m in a rush to find all the answers and “evolve” my knowledge. It’s how I’ve gotten into more than one scrape.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_6
TEXT: But even when you’re growing, it’s good to appreciate where you are in life. That goes for you too, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_7
TEXT: Next, let’s take a look at the Pokémon Pupitar is so eager to evolve into!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_0
TEXT: I thought I felt an earthquake, but it was just your Tyranitar walking around, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_1
TEXT: And look how powerful it’s become—from its humble beginnings burrowing up through the earth to making the surface shake with every stomp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_2
TEXT: In fact, Tyranitar is so overwhelmingly powerful that it can bring down a whole mountain to make its nest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_3
TEXT: It’s also known to wander about in mountain ranges looking for new opponents to fight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_4
TEXT: Luckily, Tyranitar will ignore opponents it doesn’t consider worthy. I’m probably safe!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_5
TEXT: But it does make you wonder how they’re able to gauge an opponent’s strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_6
TEXT: Hmm... Maybe you’ll get some insight on that as you travel with Tyranitar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_7
TEXT: And if you do, be sure to let your favorite professor know! In any case, congratulations on befriending yet another mighty Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_8
TEXT: Thanks for an exciting day of research, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! You know, I had an odd dream the other night... I was spitting fire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_1
TEXT: Then the strangest coincidence happened—when I woke up, there were more Litten around than usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_2
TEXT: I’d love to observe them more closely, but it takes time to get them to trust you, so it’s easier said than done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_3
TEXT: But I bet with that spark and determination of yours, you just might be able to get some of them to warm up to you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_0
TEXT: Color me impressed! It’s amazing that you managed to gain their trust so quickly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_1
TEXT: For my part, I just can’t help smothering Litten with attention—though I’m sure they’d rather I didn’t.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_2
TEXT: How do I know? Because if you try too hard to get close to one, it won’t open up to you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_3
TEXT: Tell you what—why don’t you try evolving Litten into Torracat, then fill me in on what you learn in the process of building your friendship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_0
TEXT: Brilliant work, Trainer! Let’s have a look at your fiery new Torracat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_1
TEXT: Take a peek at its throat—see that bell of flame? It rings brightly whenever Torracat spits fire.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_2
TEXT: It also boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_3
TEXT: How about we help this fur-ocious fighter burn even brighter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_0
TEXT: Whew! Why do I feel like I’m about to melt?! Oh—you’ve evolved your Torracat into Incineroar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_1
TEXT: Did you know the temperature of the flames from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit? And that’s not all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_2
TEXT: Incineroar is equally formidable when it’s hurling ferocious punches or flinging furious kicks! Speaking of formidable, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve really evolved into quite the Trainer yourself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how much further you’ll go. Until next time, keep that fire of yours burning hot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Is it just me, or is there a ghostly chill in the air?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_1
TEXT: It could have something to do with those lights over there! They belong to Litwick, the Candle Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_2
TEXT: Litwick is known to leech off the life force of any who follow it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_3
TEXT: The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns. Makes for a pretty ominous candle, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_4
TEXT: Litwick appearing in such force makes the perfect chance to learn more about them. I suggest you get up close and see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_5
TEXT: Just be careful not to let Litwick lead you anywhere, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_0
TEXT: Good day, Trainer. Professor Willow has tasked you with investigating...Litwick, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_1
TEXT: The flame on its head is certainly alluring. A Pokémon that can bring light to its surroundings… What could be the source of its brilliant glow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_2
TEXT: “Life force,” Professor Willow says? Peculiar. I wonder—would those flames transform if Litwick were to evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_3
TEXT: What are your thoughts, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! You went looking for Litwick and came back with a lamp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_1
TEXT: I kid—I know a Lampent when I see one! And it was Rhi who suggested you help Litwick evolve? That’s great. We can always learn more when encouraged by our friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_2
TEXT: So, let me tell you about Lampent! While it often pretends to be a lamp, Lampent is usually feared as an emissary of death.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_3
TEXT: Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen. Spooky, but appropriate for the season!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_4
TEXT: And what a sight that fire is. I’m sure you and Rhi would get a kick out of seeing Lampent’s Evolution, Chandelure, too! But a word of caution, %PLAYERNAME%...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_5
TEXT: They say spirits burned up in Chandelure's ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_0
TEXT: That new Pokémon...
... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_1
TEXT: Oh. My apologies, %PLAYERNAME%. I was...preoccupied gazing at the flame your Pokémon is emanating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_2
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_3
TEXT: The swaying of its arms is rather hypnotic.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_4
TEXT: It's called "Chandelure," is it? And Professor Willow said its flames can burn up spirits? An unsettling thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_5
TEXT: The Pokémon we studied today could easily be seen as frightening. Yet I believe there is a lesson we can take from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_6
TEXT: No matter how dark the world becomes, a little light always persists.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_7
TEXT: Thank you for teaching me that lesson once again, %PLAYERNAME%. Take care, and I will see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess what? I was observing a herd of Ponyta last night, and I saw a shooting star! Or maybe it was a spark from fighting Shinx?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_1
TEXT: In any case, it looks like it was a lucky star—I wished you’d turn up today, and here you are!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_2
TEXT: Now it’s your turn. What do you wish to research today, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1
TEXT: You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2
TEXT: Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3
TEXT: And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4
TEXT: Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5
TEXT: How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6
TEXT: Good luck—and have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0
TEXT: Great work as always, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1
TEXT: I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2
TEXT: These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4
TEXT: I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_5
TEXT: After all, the best Trainers never stop training!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6
TEXT: Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0
TEXT: How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1
TEXT: I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2
TEXT: It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3
TEXT: Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4
TEXT: Enough about that, though—back to our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5
TEXT: This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6
TEXT: Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0
TEXT: Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1
TEXT: I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2
TEXT: Anyway, I should probably get back to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3
TEXT: But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4
TEXT: I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5
TEXT: I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6
TEXT: Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1
TEXT: As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2
TEXT: Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3
TEXT: I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4
TEXT: That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5
TEXT: Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6
TEXT: Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0
TEXT: Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1
TEXT: I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2
TEXT: I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3
TEXT: Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4
TEXT: Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5
TEXT: How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6
TEXT: Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0
TEXT: Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1
TEXT: I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2
TEXT: I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3
TEXT: That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4
TEXT: Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5
TEXT: To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6
TEXT: They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2
TEXT: The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3
TEXT: The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4
TEXT: I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5
TEXT: I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_6
TEXT: Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_1
TEXT: I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2
TEXT: We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3
TEXT: A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4
TEXT: It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_5
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6
TEXT: I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0
TEXT: You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1
TEXT: You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2
TEXT: I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3
TEXT: For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5
TEXT: She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6
TEXT: With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1
TEXT: Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2
TEXT: To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3
TEXT: There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4
TEXT: No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5
TEXT: I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6
TEXT: It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2
TEXT: Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3
TEXT: I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4
TEXT: Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5
TEXT: And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0
TEXT: I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1
TEXT: But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2
TEXT: In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3
TEXT: A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4
TEXT: Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5
TEXT: Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6
TEXT: Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0
TEXT: Impressive work, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1
TEXT: I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2
TEXT: Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3
TEXT: Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4
TEXT: Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5
TEXT: I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6
TEXT: Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1
TEXT: Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2
TEXT: We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3
TEXT: I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4
TEXT: Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5
TEXT: As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6
TEXT: I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0
TEXT: Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1
TEXT: It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2
TEXT: You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4
TEXT: Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5
TEXT: I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_1
TEXT: Come look at this. See that there, in the dirt?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—footprints! Though not human ones, I’d wager.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_3
TEXT: You’d be hard pressed to find shoes that would fit whatever feet made these, I think! There must be a Pokémon responsible, though I’m not sure which one...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’m going to stick around and see if I can’t learn a bit more from these footprints, so why don’t you follow them and see where they take you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_5
TEXT: Make sure to snap some photos of your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! That Ground-type Pokémon you caught looks spectacular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Drilbur, the Mole Pokémon, can dig through the ground at incredible speeds?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_2
TEXT: In the Galar region, Drilbur often leave farmers in a tizzy because they damage their crops. Sounds like mole than they can handle, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, while you were out, I received reports that the Pokémon we’re looking for has vines on its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_4
TEXT: How about you search the bushes nearby to see if you can find any vines? Don’t forget to snap some photos, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You got a great shot of that Bug-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_1
TEXT: I encountered a curious Bug-type Pokémon myself, actually: Combee.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Tiny Bee Pokémon, Combee is actually a trio! The three work together to collect honey and deliver it to their colony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_3
TEXT: Such abundant teamwork sure is admirable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_4
TEXT: I’m sure our team leaders strive to achieve that same level of synergy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, the Combee I saw got me thinking: Maybe we’ve been searching too close to the ground. If my hypothesis is correct, we’re on the trail of a Pokémon that can sometimes be seen hopping from tree to tree.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_6
TEXT: This time, try searching among the trees to see if you can find any leads. And don’t forget to photograph your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Sweet Nuzleaf.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_1
TEXT: I believe the Pokémon we’re after tends to live deep in forests—much like Nuzleaf does—so we should be on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_2
TEXT: Ah, look—your Nuzleaf just started playing its grass flute!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_3
TEXT: The sound of it is said to make its listeners uneasy. I wonder if it’s trying to lead the Pokémon out into the open...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_4
TEXT: Wait, what was that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_5
TEXT: Look there! A dark shadow just dashed across the sky! Keep your eyes up, %PLAYERNAME%, and chase after it! Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_0
TEXT: Great job out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_1
TEXT: The photo you sent me speaks to your efforts. And I see you made a new friend in that Rufflet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_2
TEXT: Did you know that Rufflet will challenge Pokémon stronger than itself, even if it might lose? That’s how it pushes itself to grow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_3
TEXT: Pretty brave, huh? I think bravery is exactly what we’ll need as we prepare to encounter the mysterious Pokémon we’ve been tracking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_4
TEXT: Thanks to all the information we’ve gathered, I’m certain that we’re dealing with Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_5
TEXT: The Mythical Pokémon Zarude tend to live in packs in the forest, but it looks like the one we’ve been following is all on its own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_6
TEXT: Sounds like the perfect chance to catch it, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_7
TEXT: With everything we’ve learned—and all the Pokémon friends you’ve made along the way—I’m sure you’ll succeed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_0
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_1
TEXT: Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_2
TEXT: What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_3
TEXT: Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_4
TEXT: Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_5
TEXT: I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_6
TEXT: Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_7
TEXT: Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_8
TEXT: Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_9
TEXT: Could you head out and learn more about Machop?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_1
TEXT: The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_2
TEXT: Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_4
TEXT: A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_5
TEXT: As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_0
TEXT: Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_1
TEXT: Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_2
TEXT: It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_3
TEXT: Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_4
TEXT: Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_5
TEXT: Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_6
TEXT: Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_7
TEXT: Moving right along…

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_8
TEXT: How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_1
TEXT: The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_2
TEXT: Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_3
TEXT: I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_4
TEXT: You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1
TEXT: All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2
TEXT: Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3
TEXT: Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4
TEXT: Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5
TEXT: However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2
TEXT: Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3
TEXT: I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4
TEXT: Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0
TEXT: Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1
TEXT: Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3
TEXT: So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4
TEXT: Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1
TEXT: I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2
TEXT: Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3
TEXT: I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4
TEXT: Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2
TEXT: Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3
TEXT: There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4
TEXT: I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5
TEXT: Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6
TEXT: Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1
TEXT: As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2
TEXT: My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4
TEXT: When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5
TEXT: And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6
TEXT: As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0
TEXT: You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2
TEXT: Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3
TEXT: Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4
TEXT: There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1
TEXT: Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2
TEXT: Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3
TEXT: Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4
TEXT: See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_1
TEXT: Is it just me, or are our surroundings looking...fluffier than usual today? It must be all these Mareep around!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_2
TEXT: Mareep might look tantalizingly soft, but a word of warning before you go in for a hug—static electricity builds up in their fluffy coat, so touching one will give you quite a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_3
TEXT: In lieu of a Mareep cuddle, how about a Mareep huddle? Let’s put our heads together and see what we can learn about this wonderful Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_1
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at the Mareep you just caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that it stores air in its wool coat, allowing it to stay cool when it’s hot and warm when it’s cold?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_3
TEXT: In the warm months, its fleece is fully shed, but it grows back in a week.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_4
TEXT: Then, when cool weather blows in and brings dry air with it, Mareep’s wool doubles in size and the tip of its tail glows slightly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_5
TEXT: Say, why don’t you help a few Mareep evolve so we can learn more about Flaaffy, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! Those are some happy-looking Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_1
TEXT: Flaaffy’s fluffy fleece can store lots of electricity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_2
TEXT: So much, in fact, that it has developed patches of rubbery skin that don’t conduct electricity. This helps protect Flaaffy from being electrocuted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_3
TEXT: Like Mareep, Flaaffy’s tail is a great indicator of how much electric charge it has stored. When its coat is fully charged, its tail lights up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_4
TEXT: Flaffy’s Evolution, Ampharos, also has an impressive tail...but let’s not get ahead of ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_5
TEXT: I’ll tell you more about that after you’ve helped Flaaffy evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_0
TEXT: Wool-hoo, %PLAYERNAME%! That is one dazzling Ampharos!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_1
TEXT: Did you know the tip of Ampharos’s tail shines so brightly that it can be seen from space? That’s no tall tale! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_2
TEXT: This Pokémon’s light has been treasured by people since ancient times. It acts as a beacon for the lost—and in the olden days, people used it to send signals back and forth across great distances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_3
TEXT: It’s no wonder Ampharos is known as the Light Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_4
TEXT: I just know it’ll shine bright in all your wonderful adventures together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for spending the day learning with me. I’ll see you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5
TEXT: I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I’d sure like to hope so! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6
TEXT: Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that—you’ve caught all of Alola’s first partner Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: They make for quite the iconic trio.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our Alola-inspired research today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: There’s even a Trainers’ School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don’t you go meet some new Pokémon and send some Gifts to your friends?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3
TEXT: I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you take a stroll yourself? I’ll be here when you get back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Ula’Ula Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3
TEXT: It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you head out and find some new Pokémon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2
TEXT: Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3
TEXT: I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pokémon, and even its guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3
TEXT: But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4
TEXT: They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5
TEXT: Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6
TEXT: Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7
TEXT: Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8
TEXT: For now, continue your island research. I’ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon. For now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3a_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Did your friends like their Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3b_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How was your adventure? Did you see anything new? You’ll have to tell me all about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3c_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Let me take a look at the Pokémon you’ve returned with... I bet with some training, you and your Pokémon would be ready to take on Alola’s Pokémon League yourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3d_0
TEXT: Welcome back! I knew you’d have no trouble with Team GO Rocket. You never do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_0
TEXT: ... ... ... *sigh* ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_1
TEXT: Oh. Hey, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_2
TEXT: ... ... ... *sigh*

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_3
TEXT: Sorry. I’ve just been feeling kinda burnt out lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_4
TEXT: I hate to say it, but my battling techniques have gotten stale. I need to reignite my inner fire somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_5
TEXT: Wait—I’ve got an idea! Professor Willow’s always talking about how great you are at Pokémon battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_6
TEXT: How about letting me see some of that passion in action? Watching you battle might be just what I need!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_7
TEXT: You’ll help me out, yeah? Nice. I knew you’d agree, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_8
TEXT: Let’s make sure our teams are in top shape, then we’ll get to it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_0
TEXT: I’m all set, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_1
TEXT: My team’s raring to see you and your Pokémon blaze into the fray!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_2
TEXT: So. Where should we start? There’s plenty of options—take on a Gym, battle with friends, go a couple rounds in the GO Battle League...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_3
TEXT: You and I could even go head-to-head!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_4
TEXT: Oh—I’ve got it! See that Team GO Rocket Grunt over there?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_5
TEXT: Let’s take ’em down. We can save whatever Pokémon they’ve got their hands on and flex your battle skills at the same time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_0
TEXT: You’re on fire, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_1
TEXT: Didja see how fast that Grunt ran off? Hah! You smoked ’em.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_2
TEXT: Speaking of Grunts, they’ve been acting weird lately. The last few I battled acted off after I beat ’em. Usually they throw a huffy quip at me before sulking off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_3
TEXT: But lately they just laugh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_4
TEXT: Rrrgh... Think I need to up the intensity? Maybe have Ponyta give ’em a good Stomp at the end?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_5
TEXT: Anyway. Enough analyzing—that’s Blanche’s thing. Let’s get back to battling. Why don’t we find a Gym you can take on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_0
TEXT: That was a blistering battle, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_1
TEXT: My mind’s ablaze with new ways to train.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_2
TEXT: Thanks for helping me find my fire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_3
TEXT: I should probably be the one teaching you stuff, but you know plenty already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_4
TEXT: Does that mean you’re looking to take up the reins of team leader yourself? Hah, I could get behind that!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_5
TEXT: You know, you really gave me the inspiration I needed—I’d say that’s pretty heroic.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_6
TEXT: All right. Enough talk. Ponyta and I are off to get in some training. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%! And you better be ready to battle the next time you see me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_8
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I have something exciting planned for you today—you could even say it’s a mega surprise! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2
TEXT: While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1
TEXT: The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_2
TEXT: While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: Let’s Mega Evolve Venusaur and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2b_0

TEXT: What a magnificent Mega Venusaur, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_1
TEXT: Let’s keep growing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Venusaur? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_2
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you, as always.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_2
TEXT: Or maybe it’s because more and more Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region have been coming to visit me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_3
TEXT: Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It’s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_4
TEXT: Alola even has Pokémon whose appearances are different than their counterparts in other regions. You may have encountered some of them before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you try looking for some Pokémon that were first discovered in Alola while I rustle up another glass of juice? I’m sure we have a lot to learn about our visitors!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_0
TEXT: Good timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I just finished my juice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for looking into the Alola region’s Pokémon! You’re as diligent as ever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_2
TEXT: Let me take a look at what you’ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pokémon you just met can be found on Alola’s Melemele Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_3
TEXT: Melemele Island is where many of Alola’s Trainers begin their island challenge. It’s very fitting that the Pokémon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_4
TEXT: Now, let’s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pokémon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_0
TEXT: Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pokémon already seem to be closer. But who doesn’t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it’s time for another glass of juice...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_1
TEXT: Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island’s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_2
TEXT: Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_3
TEXT: The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pokémon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_4
TEXT: Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What’s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_1
TEXT: And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he’d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_3
TEXT: Or did someone do something to anger it? I’ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_5
TEXT: I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let’s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pokémon wearing fun costumes recently? I’ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_1
TEXT: It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I’m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_2
TEXT: Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pokémon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pokémon feel when they wear those costumes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_3
TEXT: Sounds to me like some research is in order!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_1
TEXT: I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who’d been sorting through some Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_2
TEXT: Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pokémon that rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_3
TEXT: Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_4
TEXT: I wonder how different Pokémon react to different foods. While I go on a Berry run, why don’t you do some research on how Pokémon feel after eating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full—and my stomach rumbly! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_1
TEXT: Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_2
TEXT: I wasn’t able to look into it further at the time—my hands were quite full with Berries—but I’m hoping we can investigate it together soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_3
TEXT: For now, could you continue researching how people and Pokémon express themselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_4
TEXT: For many Trainers and their Pokémon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pokémon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see for yourself? I’ll be cheering you on from here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_1
TEXT: While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_2
TEXT: Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_3
TEXT: Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you’ll be able to catch Meloetta’s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d find a way to catch Meloetta’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_1
TEXT: They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it’s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_2
TEXT: I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I’m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_0
TEXT: Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%—I didn’t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_2
TEXT: Whether it’s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pokémon battle or battle of the bands, there’s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What’s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_3
TEXT: Maybe you’re still figuring it out—and that’s totally fine. Everyone’s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support—and Meloetta’s, too. Now, let’s get out there and show the world who we are!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1
TEXT: That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2
TEXT: I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3
TEXT: Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4
TEXT: I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5
TEXT: Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6
TEXT: So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7
TEXT: Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8
TEXT: But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1
TEXT: While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2
TEXT: But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3
TEXT: If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4
TEXT: But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5
TEXT: Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_6
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1
TEXT: Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_2
TEXT: What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3
TEXT: He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4
TEXT: Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5
TEXT: I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6
TEXT: Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1
TEXT: This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2
TEXT: But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_3
TEXT: In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_0
TEXT: Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_1
TEXT: Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2
TEXT: Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_3
TEXT: I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4
TEXT: I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_5
TEXT: {0}
{1}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_6
TEXT: Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_7
TEXT: By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_0
TEXT: Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1
TEXT: Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_2
TEXT: This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_3
TEXT: Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_4
TEXT: Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_0
TEXT: Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_1
TEXT: According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_2
TEXT: People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_3
TEXT: We need to find out more about Pokémon that wield tools. Could you complete the following research tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_0
TEXT: I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_1
TEXT: There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_2
TEXT: Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_3
TEXT: Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_4
TEXT: We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_0
TEXT: I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1
TEXT: Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_2
TEXT: Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_3
TEXT: Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_4
TEXT: Enjoy exploring, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’m sure we’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_2
TEXT: I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_1
TEXT: I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_2
TEXT: Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_1
TEXT: A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_2
TEXT: My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_3
TEXT: According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I’d love to see a Mudkip, when—wouldn’t you know it—I came across a whole mess of them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_1
TEXT: Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water’s edge? Sounds adorable, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_2
TEXT: One of the many things that’s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_3
TEXT: When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_4
TEXT: It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_5
TEXT: Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve brought a Mudkip with you—nice work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_1
TEXT: Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what’s going on around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_2
TEXT: I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip’s Evolution, Marshtomp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_3
TEXT: Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp’s legs sturdy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_4
TEXT: And because it’s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_5
TEXT: While I clean my coat off, why don’t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_0
TEXT: I knew I should’ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_1
TEXT: Don’t you think it’s inspiring how Pokémon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_2
TEXT: Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert—Marshtomp’s Evolution—while you were away!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_3
TEXT: Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_4
TEXT: I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_5
TEXT: ...What’s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that’s an option... But not quite as fun, don’t you think? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_6
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pokémon really are incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_1
TEXT: Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it’s strong enough to tow a large ship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_2
TEXT: I guess you know which Pokémon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_3
TEXT: You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_4
TEXT: It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pokémon. I hope you’ve enjoyed yourself today as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry, I didn’t notice you there. I’m trying to figure out where my Pinap Berries went. Maybe you could help me figure it out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_2
TEXT: You see, Pinap Berries have been particularly abundant around here as of late. I’ve never seen so many growing at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_3
TEXT: It’s like the soil’s been filled with nature’s energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_4
TEXT: Pinap fan that I am, I picked a basketful to juice and set it down right over there, but I got distracted reading this paper on regional differences in Slowpoke.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_5
TEXT: And when I turned around, the whole basket was empty!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_6
TEXT: I suppose now I have a wonderful excuse to go for a stroll and gather more...but all the same, I’m curious why they vanished in the first place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_7
TEXT: While I pick more Berries, %PLAYERNAME%, can you poke around and see if any Pokémon in the area might be responsible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_1
TEXT: Excuse my sudden wobbling. I take it you’ve found yourself some Noibat! Their enormous ears can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_2
TEXT: For the record, even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to Noibat’s ultrasonic waves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_3
TEXT: At any rate, I think you’ve found our culprit, since fruits are its favorite foods. That must be why they swiped my Pinap Berries! Well, I’m always more than happy to share with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_4
TEXT: But there’s a silver lining to finding our Berry bandit—now we’ve got the perfect Pokémon to research today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_5
TEXT: See if you can attract more Noibat with Pinap Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! Those Noibat sure look happy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_1
TEXT: I suppose Noibat and I share an appreciation for Pinap Berries, huh? And it’s no phase, I assure you—Noibat’s love of fruit persists even after evolving into Noivern.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_2
TEXT: Although Noivern have a violent disposition, if you give them a nice ripe fruit that they love, they will suddenly become tame.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_3
TEXT: Y’know, there’s an idea—why not help your Noibat evolve into Noivern, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_4
TEXT: I reckon the Pinap Berries you fed them will keep that temper of theirs at bay!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I must say, your Noivern looks pretty chipper.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_1
TEXT: My research says that this Pokémon is often aggressive and will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark. Yikes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_2
TEXT: Luckily for us, your Noivern looks quite fond of you! I’m sure you’ll continue to be great friends, even if you don’t have its beloved fruits on hand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for spending the day learning with me. It’s always fun when we find something we have in common with Pokémon, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_4
TEXT: Of course, I’m talking about a love of Berries—not sharing a cruel disposition!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_5
TEXT: I hope you’d agree with that, right, %PLAYERNAME%?
...Right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0
TEXT: Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you, %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow. I’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’ll be guiding you on your journey—and what a journey it shall be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1
TEXT: You’ll also be helping me with my research along the way. So really, we’re more like colleagues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2
TEXT: First things first—let’s go over how to catch Pokémon, make a Curveball Throw, and transfer Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3
TEXT: You can catch Pokémon with Poké Balls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4
TEXT: If you throw a Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and time your throw just right, you can even achieve a Nice, Great, or Excellent Throw!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5
TEXT: Curveball Throws are advanced throws that can help you grow even more as a Trainer. To make a Curveball Throw, spin the Poké Ball as you throw it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6
TEXT: It’s OK if you don’t get it at first. That’s what practice is for!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7
TEXT: Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon storage or transfer them to my mobile lab in exchange for Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8
TEXT: I’ll explain more about Candy later. For now, how about you go catch some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll be making Excellent Curveball Throws as easily as a Goldeen swims in water!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2
TEXT: Next, I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created called Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3
TEXT: It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4
TEXT: If you know you’re going to be out adventuring for a while, using Incense can really boost the amount of Pokémon you encounter. It’s one of my favorite items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5
TEXT: Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several different types that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6
TEXT: For example, Nanab Berries calm Pokémon down, making it easier for you to aim a Poké Ball at them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7
TEXT: How about you give these items a try? Go ahead and use an Incense to attract Pokémon. Then, use Nanab Berries to help you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work using Incense and Berries to help you catch Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1
TEXT: If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can visit PokéStops to get more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2
TEXT: Spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop can grant you those items as well as other goodies. You can also get Field Research tasks by doing so, which you can complete to encounter Pokémon or receive items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3
TEXT: PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a monument, a public park, or a local café.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4
TEXT: They encourage Trainers to explore the world around them. Isn’t that exciting?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go do some exploring? Who knows—you might discover some interesting places!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I just returned from a stroll myself. One thing I love about Field Research is how it always manages to take me to new and exciting locations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1
TEXT: I hope you get to learn a bit more about the world around you as you seek out different PokéStops!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2
TEXT: And as fun as that will be, it’ll be even more fun if you bring along a Buddy Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3
TEXT: Building strong relationships with your Pokémon is pivotal to being a good Trainer—and choosing a Pokémon to be your buddy is a great way to do just that!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_4
TEXT: You can choose any Pokémon to be your Buddy Pokémon. It can even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_5
TEXT: To get your buddy to join you on your adventures, give it some treats, such as Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_6
TEXT: You can boost your friendship with your Buddy Pokémon even further by playing with it, taking photos of it, and battling with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_7
TEXT: Eventually, your Buddy Pokémon can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! You’ll also earn additional Candy when you walk around with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_8
TEXT: We’ll cover the importance of Candy later, but for now, how about you pick out a Buddy Pokémon and spend some time with it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your Buddy Pokémon’s looking pretty pleased! Seeing your bond grow stronger warms my heart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_1
TEXT: Keep taking care of your Pokémon to make your relationship flourish!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy, too. It’s now time to learn how you can get more Candy, as well as what you can use it for.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_3
TEXT: You can earn Candy by catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon. You can then use that Candy to power up and evolve your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_4
TEXT: You’ll also need Stardust, which you can earn by catching Pokémon, hatching Eggs, completing research, and opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_5
TEXT: Evolving Pokémon helps you fill out your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential. There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_6
TEXT: Be sure to check the Pokémon in your Pokémon storage to learn more about how to evolve them. You’ll also be able to power up your Pokémon there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_7
TEXT: If you need help figuring out which Pokémon to power up and evolve, you can ask your team leader to appraise your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_8
TEXT: You should have some Candy and Stardust from completing previous research tasks. How about you use them to evolve and power up some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new while evolving and powering up your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_1
TEXT: When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_2
TEXT: But as exciting as that all is, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_3
TEXT: Next, we’re going to discuss Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_4
TEXT: You can get 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km Eggs by spinning PokéStops, and you can get 7 km Eggs by opening Gifts from your friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_5
TEXT: To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the indicated distance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_6
TEXT: If you want to hatch Eggs even faster, Super Incubators decrease the distance required to hatch Eggs. Be sure to use these Incubators wisely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_7
TEXT: You’ll be able to get Eggs in other ways, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_8
TEXT: For example, you can get Strange Eggs by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders. As you go on your Trainer journey, you’ll have opportunities to take on Team GO Rocket and obtain these Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_9
TEXT: You should have a handful of Eggs already. How about you get to hatching some?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_0
TEXT: Look at all the Eggs you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_1
TEXT: Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, wouldn’t you say? Even so, you can’t forget to have fun along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_2
TEXT: You’ll see in your Item Bag that you have a camera. You can use this camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon and commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_3
TEXT: You can take a snapshot when encountering wild Pokémon, when viewing your Pokémon in your Pokémon storage, and when interacting with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_4
TEXT: How about you give it a shot? A...snapshot, that is. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve been looking through the photos you took, and I have to say, I’m quite impressed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_1
TEXT: Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You certainly have the chops for it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_10
TEXT: An important part of battling effectively is using attacks that are super effective against the Pokémon defending the Gym.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_11
TEXT: Different Pokémon and their attacks have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types. For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_12
TEXT: I’d like for you to try using supereffective attacks when battling at a Gym. Try using Charged Attacks of different types to see which ones work best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_13
TEXT: Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_2
TEXT: Do you recognize these structures? I’m sure you’ve come across them in your photographic forays.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_3
TEXT: They’re called Gyms, and they’ll prove to be quite important in your Trainer journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_4
TEXT: Gyms are always one of four colors, depending on which team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_5
TEXT: Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela. Blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_6
TEXT: Yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_7
TEXT: Gray Gyms are neutral, meaning that no team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_8
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by your team, you can assign a Pokémon to defend it. Gyms can have up to six Pokémon defending them at a time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_9
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by another team, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team, and give battling a shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_0
TEXT: How was your Gym experience, %PLAYERNAME%? A unique kind of workout, isn’t it? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_1
TEXT: Anyhoo, did you notice that at some Gyms, you were faced with a single Pokémon instead of Gym defenders?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_2
TEXT: Those Pokémon are called Raid Bosses, and you can challenge them in Raid Battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_3
TEXT: In Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to challenge a Raid Boss.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_4
TEXT: These Pokémon are formidable foes, indeed. Sometimes, you can find certain Pokémon only as Raid Bosses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_5
TEXT: Before entering a Raid Battle, make sure to power up your Pokémon! Stocking up on lots of Candy and Stardust will allow you to bring powerful teams to Raid Battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_6
TEXT: Power up some Pokémon, then try taking on a raid. If you don’t succeed, you can team up with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m hoping you can help me with something. You see, I was out for a walk recently and noticed several trees covered in slash marks—and I think I know what made them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1
TEXT: There’s a Pokémon called Oshawott—the Sea Otter Pokémon—that keeps a scalchop on its stomach that it can detach and use as a blade. I’ve seen a lot of Oshawott around lately, so I’m thinking they may be our mystery tree carvers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2
TEXT: Could you catch some Oshawott so we can learn more about them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about Oshawott, I was hoping we could turn our attention to its Evolution, Dewott. Don’t let its cute appearance fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2
TEXT: Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, Dewott uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action! Can you evolve your Oshawott for me, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0
TEXT: Wow, Dewott’s double-scalchop technique is incredible! Pokémon truly never cease to amaze, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1
TEXT: I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time, and here we have Pokémon mastering bespoke battle techniques. It’s inspiring stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2
TEXT: I think I’ve gained a better understanding of Dewott—which means we can begin studying its Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3
TEXT: Dewott’s Evolution, Samurott, is known to wield swords called seamitars incorporated in its armor. Apparently, Samurott can draw and sheathe its seamitars in the time it takes a foe to blink.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4
TEXT: Not hard to see why it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Why don’t you evolve Dewott so we can witness Samurott’s majesty for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! That’s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them, too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! You’ll never guess what I saw on my walk earlier. It was a pond full of Poliwag!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_0_1
TEXT: Poliwag tend to stay in water because they’re unsteady on their newly grown legs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_0_2
TEXT: They seem to aspire to land-based locomotion, though, so they do their best to waddle along when they get out of the water.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_0_3
TEXT: Isn’t that moving? Those little Pokémon, trying their best against the odds to improve themselves... *sniff*

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_0_4
TEXT: We could all learn something from Poliwag about stepping out of our comfort zones. How about you take the chance to observe some now?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How did your observations go? Did you see any Poliwag waddling around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_1
TEXT: Some researchers recommend that Trainers bring their Poliwag on walks every day to strengthen its legs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_2
TEXT: Of course, such regimented training isn’t necessary for Poliwhirl, Poliwag’s Evolution. Its two legs are well developed, and it can be seen marching all over in search of bug Pokémon to eat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving a Poliwag, %PLAYERNAME%? But be careful you don’t look at Poliwhirl’s swirl for too long. I’ll tell you about THAT when you get back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_0
TEXT: Nice Poliwhirl, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_1
TEXT: Do you see the distinctive swirl on its belly? Staring at it causes drowsiness.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_10
TEXT: So, are you curious to see Poliwhirl’s Evolutions for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_2
TEXT: In fact, parents have been known to use it in place of lullabies to help their children go to sleep.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_3
TEXT: It’s a great Pokémon to have around when you’re struggling with insomnia, but less so when you’re *yaaawn* in the middle of...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_4
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_5
TEXT: ...Ack! Sorry, %PLAYERNAME%—looking at your Poliwhirl almost put me to sleep! Now, where was I? Ah, yes! Another special trait of Poliwhirl’s is that it can evolve into two different Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_6
TEXT: First, we have the brawny Poliwrath. Its body is solid muscle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_7
TEXT: When swimming through cold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to smash through drifting ice and plow forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_8
TEXT: And second, we have the commanding Politoed! It’s the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl. When Politoed roars, they all cower in fear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_9
TEXT: Its cries sound like screams, but they actually served as inspiration for a beautiful ballad. I’d sure love to hear it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What Pokémon did you decide to evolve your Poliwhirl into?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_3_1
TEXT: Poliwrath? Politoed? One of each, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_3_2
TEXT: Whatever the case, remember to approach your research like a Poliwag learning how to walk—one step at a time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m feeling inspired after seeing your Poliwag’s journey, and I hope you are, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_3_4
TEXT: Until next time—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3
TEXT: Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_4
TEXT: Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_5
TEXT: Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_6
TEXT: In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2
TEXT: With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3
TEXT: I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4
TEXT: But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5
TEXT: Now, let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_1
TEXT: I was knee-deep in the last lake I thought to check—shoes soggy, Dewpider on all sides—when I finally, FINALLY, saw Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_2
TEXT: I’d love to tell you more about it, but I need to scribble down all the details in my journal while they’re fresh in my mind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_3
TEXT: You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_1
TEXT: You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_2
TEXT: Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_3
TEXT: That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4
TEXT: Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5
TEXT: Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6
TEXT: Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7
TEXT: It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8
TEXT: But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe our luck? It’s a wonder to see so many Popplio gathered in one place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_1
TEXT: I’ve heard these hardworking Pokémon can inflate balloons with their noses. How fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_2
TEXT: They practice diligently so they can learn to make bigger and bigger balloons.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_3
TEXT: Studying the Sea Lion Pokémon will surely be a show. Why don’t you try catching one so we can see these skills up close?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic job, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad to see Popplio’s acrobatic prowess didn’t get the better of you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_1_1
TEXT: Blowing up those balloons isn’t just for show, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_1_2
TEXT: In battle, the sheer force of the bursting balloons can damage opponents.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_1_3
TEXT: Popplio’s charm doesn’t end there, either. Try evolving your Popplio into Brionne, and you’ll see what I mean!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_0
TEXT: You did it, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Brionne has a magnetic stage presence. Just look at it go—it’s quite the performer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_1
TEXT: Have you been teaching it some new moves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_2
TEXT: Brionne is bound to be an entertaining new companion. I’ve heard that when their Trainers are feeling down, Brionne perform a cheery dance to help perk them up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_3
TEXT: You know, your Brionne may be ready to take its talents to the next stage. Let’s evolve this dancer into Primarina!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_3_0
TEXT: Bravo, %PLAYERNAME%! Just look at your magnificent Primarina. This songstress takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_3_1
TEXT: I’m feeling quite starstruck by its fantastical appearance, myself! ...Do you think I can get an autograph?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_3_2
TEXT: Thank you for helping me fine-tune my research today. I hope you and Primarina finish today on a high note.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_popplio_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how far you can take its career—both on and off the stage of battle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2
TEXT: Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3
TEXT: I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1
TEXT: I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2
TEXT: Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_3
TEXT: Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4
TEXT: Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5
TEXT: Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6
TEXT: I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2
TEXT: According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3
TEXT: The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4
TEXT: These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_6
TEXT: For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_1
TEXT: I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2
TEXT: According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3
TEXT: Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4
TEXT: It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_5
TEXT: Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_6
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re not going to believe this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_1
TEXT: Have you seen those Poké Ball–like Pokémon rolling about?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_10
TEXT: This all begs the question: why are Hisuian Voltorb appearing now after being absent for so long? Did they somehow travel to the present from the Sinnoh region of the past?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_11
TEXT: I have a theory that when Team GO Rocket broke open the mysterious door, it somehow caused these Hisuian Voltorb to appear in our time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_12
TEXT: Now why am I suddenly reminded of Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_13
TEXT: Anyway, that’s all I’ve got! Kind of unbelievable, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_14
TEXT: I’m going to do some more digging on my end, and I’d love your help researching these bygone Pokémon out in the field!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_15
TEXT: Let’s investigate Hisuian Voltorb together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_2
TEXT: They look an awful lot like Voltorb—a Pokémon native to the Kanto region, among others—but I’ve never seen any Voltorb quite like these.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_3
TEXT: I reached out to everyone I could think of and pored over all the research documents I could get my hands on, but get this: nothing in modern scholarship mentions this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_4
TEXT: However, I did eventually find something. Did you know that the Sinnoh region used to be known as the Hisui region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_5
TEXT: Well, I found historical documentation of an old-fashioned Poké Ball developed long ago in the Hisui region, and I realized it greatly resembles this mysterious Pokémon. Or could it be the other way around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_6
TEXT: Which came first: the Poké Ball or the Pokémon? Who knows!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_7
TEXT: Taking all this into consideration, I believe this anomalous Pokémon is, in fact, a Voltorb that once lived in the Hisui region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_8
TEXT: Is it still a regional variant if it only existed in the past? Gosh, what a puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_9
TEXT: For now, I suppose we may as well call this Pokémon Hisuian Voltorb.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_0
TEXT: I’m still reeling, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_1
TEXT: Can you believe Pokémon from a different time are now appearing around us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_10
TEXT: Anyway. Our research sure has been exciting lately, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_11
TEXT: Something tells me we’re in for even more exciting discoveries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_12
TEXT: Let’s keep at it and see what else our adventure together brings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_2
TEXT: I wonder what this Pokémon has seen in the Hisui region—and what it thinks of the future it’s suddenly seeing now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_3
TEXT: Ah, the Hisui region... I wonder what other kinds of Pokémon lived there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_4
TEXT: What I wouldn’t give to go back in time and experience the Hisui region for myself! It’d be a dream come true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_5
TEXT: Maybe if I ever meet Celebi, I could ask it for a quick trip back in time, just to sate my curiosity!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_6
TEXT: ...But I’m sure that’s not possible. It’s nice to dream, though!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve decided to research whether Hisuian Voltorb can evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_8
TEXT: I haven’t the foggiest if it can, but that won’t stop me. I want to learn everything about this strange and wonderful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_9
TEXT: After all, it’s not every day that a literal blast from the past falls into your lap! Get it? Because Voltorb can Self-Destruct? Haha...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_0
TEXT: Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_2
TEXT: Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_3
TEXT: These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_4
TEXT: As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_0
TEXT: Great job strengthening your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_1
TEXT: After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_2
TEXT: Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_3
TEXT: Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_4
TEXT: Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_1
TEXT: While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_3
TEXT: But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_4
TEXT: Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_0
TEXT: WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_1
TEXT: After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_2
TEXT: Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_3
TEXT: The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_1
TEXT: I’m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it’s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_2
TEXT: I fear there may be trouble brewing—specifically from Team GO Rocket. They’ve been too quiet for too long, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything’s amiss?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they’d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests—so neither can we!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_1
TEXT: I’m relieved to see you’ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pokémon from them already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_2
TEXT: As both a professor and as someone who loves Pokémon, I can’t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_3
TEXT: Let’s get back out there and rescue some more Pokémon from them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pokémon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_1
TEXT: They’ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_2
TEXT: But those Shadow Pokémon they’ve left behind... Well, at least they’re safe with us now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, let’s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they’ll be grateful for your help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_0
TEXT: Those Pokémon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they’re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we’d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_2
TEXT: Based on how you handled those Grunts, I’m sure the Leaders won’t stand a chance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_0
TEXT: You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you’ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_1
TEXT: It’s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pokémon everywhere.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_2
TEXT: Now. We’ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it’s time to let Giovanni know that we’re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_3
TEXT: I know he’s tough—but you’re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pokémon have an impressive bond—one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_1
TEXT: Pokémon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_2
TEXT: I know it won’t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you’re here to stop them right in their tracks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_3
TEXT: For now, though, get some rest. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_1
TEXT: There appears to be an increased number of Team GO Rocket members in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_2
TEXT: I have yet to determine what they are doing here, but I suspect that a scheme of some sort is underway.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_3
TEXT: We should investigate before they decide to cause trouble.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_0
TEXT: Thank you, Pokémon Trainer. The atmosphere is improved with fewer Team GO Rocket members present.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_1
TEXT: One detail still mystifies me. Why do the Pokémon used by Team GO Rocket possess those peculiar auras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_2
TEXT: I see. They become Shadow Pokémon through experimentation and mistreatment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_3
TEXT: So they corrupt a blameless creature, and then they abandon it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_4
TEXT: Their cruelty is unforgiveable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_5
TEXT: I am coming to realize that this group will pursue their goals relentlessly and without conscience.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_6
TEXT: We must impede them however we can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_7
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer—let us begin by rescuing some Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_0
TEXT: Those poor Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_1
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_2
TEXT: Ah—Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_3
TEXT: Apologies for my dour demeanor. I cannot stop thinking about the Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_4
TEXT: Is there nothing we can do beyond rescuing them from Team GO Rocket? Will they remain in this state forever?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_5
TEXT: Hm? You are able to...purify them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_6
TEXT: If doing so removes their ominous aura, I would like nothing more than to observe this phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_7
TEXT: Will you show me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_0
TEXT: So this is a Purified Pokémon. Its shadowy aura is gone. In its place—radiance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_1
TEXT: You are deserving of praise, Pokémon Trainer. But our efforts cannot end here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we should turn our attention to Team GO Rocket members of a higher standing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_3
TEXT: If you can defeat their leaders in battle, we may hinder their plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_0
TEXT: Those battles were among the fiercest I have witnessed, Pokémon Trainer. I am fortunate to call you my ally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_1
TEXT: Regrettably, it seems the Team GO Rocket leaders were not inspired to change their ways. They, too, have abandoned their Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_2
TEXT: But surely we have at least stalled their plans. Such an expansive organization cannot function without its leaders at full strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_3
TEXT: Hm? We must still deal with this...Giovanni, is it? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_4
TEXT: Then our work is not yet finished, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_0
TEXT: That was a fearsome battle, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_1
TEXT: I am dazzled by your capacity to overcome any challenge set before you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_2
TEXT: Please, relish your well-earned victory—but we must remain vigilant. If Team GO Rocket were to manipulate the Ultra Beasts...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_3
TEXT: We do not want their villainy to interfere with our endeavors.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_4
TEXT: For now, however, I think we can turn our attention back to the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_5
TEXT: So long as they remain open in your world, more Ultra Beasts could appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_6
TEXT: Though considering the strength you displayed today, perhaps my fear is unnecessary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_7
TEXT: In any case, thank you for allowing me to observe you today. I am pleased we were able to assist so many Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_8
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. I suspect you have already noticed, but Team GO Rocket seems to be assembling en masse again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_1
TEXT: What shadowy schemes could those ruffians be plotting? They look to be glowering right at you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_2
TEXT: Surely they couldn’t be thinking of absconding with the Ultra Beasts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_3
TEXT: Or perhaps they’ve designs on Cosmoem. In its current state, I fear—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_4
TEXT: No. Anxious speculation will not avail us. Preventative measures must come first.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_5
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. Could you use your battling skills to send some of these Grunts away?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_0
TEXT: Huh. I thought there were more Team GO Rocket Grunts around earlier...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%, it’s you! I guess I’ve got you to thank for getting those goons out of here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_2
TEXT: Rhi says they may be taking an interest in our otherworldly visitors, huh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_3
TEXT: I’m inclined to think they’re right. Good thing you’re here to save the day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_4
TEXT: Keep flushing Team GO Rocket out, %PLAYERNAME%. Try looking for their Leaders next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_5
TEXT: I’m sure you and Rhi can track them down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_0
TEXT: Brilliant work, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve managed to defeat Team GO Rocket’s Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_1
TEXT: I knew your superlative skills would lead you to victory. And you had the chance to speak with Professor Willow, correct? What did he have to say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_2
TEXT: I see... Though I am pleased Professor Willow has corroborated my theory, I continue to be concerned for the Ultra Beasts and Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_3
TEXT: I take solace in knowing that we have dispersed the majority of Team GO Rocket, if nothing else.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_4
TEXT: Now, the time has come to challenge the man who sits atop the organization: Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_0
TEXT: So, you sent Giovanni home with his tail between his legs? Just another day in the life for you, huh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_1
TEXT: It’s no easy feat to put Team GO Rocket back in their place, but you rose to the challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_2
TEXT: Great job! Now take some well-deserved rest with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_3
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_1
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%. You know, it was shaping up to be a beautiful day, but then I noticed there are more Team GO Rocket Grunts than usual lurking about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_2
TEXT: Do you think they’re up to something? Could it be connected to all the Electric-type Pokémon that’ve been around recently?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_3
TEXT: I have heard that Team GO Rocket has a reputation for causing trouble at power plants... Hm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_4
TEXT: Would you do me a favor and investigate what’s going on, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to be safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_1
TEXT: Great work dealing with those Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%. They’ll think twice before trying to battle you again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_2
TEXT: If only they’d spare as much thought for the Shadow Pokémon they’ve abandoned in their wake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_3
TEXT: I hope that one day, we’ll put a stop Team GO Rocket’s mistreatment of Pokémon once and for all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_4
TEXT: But until then, at least we can do something for the Pokémon they leave behind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_5
TEXT: Let’s purify some Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back! Those Pokémon you purified are looking better already, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_2
TEXT: Thanks for helping them—and me. It’s a relief to see them safe with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_3
TEXT: They’ll shine even brighter the longer they spend with you, I’m sure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_4
TEXT: But back to business. Next, look for Cliff, Sierra, and Arlo. We can’t let...whatever they’re doing proceed unchecked! Or untested for nefariousness, at least.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_1
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve made quick work of the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_2
TEXT: *sigh* I wish they’d change their ways. I have to give them credit—they’ve got a wealth of knowledge on Pokémon, and they’re strong Trainers to boot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_3
TEXT: Imagine what we could learn together if they used that passion for good...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_4
TEXT: I know, I know. That’s “highly improbable,” as Rhi might say. No harm in wishing, though!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_5
TEXT: Now, I have one final request. I’d like you to track down the one person I’m sure will never change: Giovanni, the head of Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_1
TEXT: Expertly handled, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew Giovanni didn’t stand a chance against you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_2
TEXT: You’re getting to be a real pro at battling him. No matter what he throws at you, there’s just no beating the bond between you and your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_3
TEXT: I think it’s time you took a rest and celebrated your victory with the Pokémon you’ve freed from Team GO Rocket’s clutches.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_4
TEXT: Let’s hope they learn their lesson one day soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_5
TEXT: See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_2
TEXT: The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_3
TEXT: We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_4
TEXT: Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_1
TEXT: As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_2
TEXT: I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_3
TEXT: There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_4
TEXT: Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_0
TEXT: Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_1
TEXT: Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_2
TEXT: It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_3
TEXT: I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_4
TEXT: While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_1
TEXT: Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_2
TEXT: If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_3
TEXT: Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_4
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_0
TEXT: You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_1
TEXT: According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_2
TEXT: There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_3
TEXT: I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_4
TEXT: If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_1
TEXT: You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_2
TEXT: It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_3
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_2
TEXT: We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_3
TEXT: I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_4
TEXT: I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_1
TEXT: You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_2
TEXT: Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_3
TEXT: We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_4
TEXT: Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_0
TEXT: Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_1
TEXT: It’s easy to tell Shadow and Purified Pokémon apart by the auras that surround them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_2
TEXT: One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_3
TEXT: It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_4
TEXT: A difficult challenge awaits you, so you need to be prepared for battle, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_0
TEXT: You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_2
TEXT: I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_3
TEXT: If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_4
TEXT: then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_0
TEXT: Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_3
TEXT: So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_1
TEXT: While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_2
TEXT: As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_3
TEXT: We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_4
TEXT: When that day comes, be sure you’re ready for the challenge!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_1
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over PokéStops and turn even more Pokémon into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_2
TEXT: Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_3
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven’t given up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_4
TEXT: We need to keep working to save Pokémon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_1
TEXT: Persistence and determination are key in our continued efforts to take down Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_2
TEXT: Please keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_3
TEXT: It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_4
TEXT: They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_0
TEXT: How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_2
TEXT: Training isn’t a one-and-done thing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_3
TEXT: Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_4
TEXT: It’s important that you’re prepared for the challenges ahead, so let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_0
TEXT: All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_1
TEXT: It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_2
TEXT: We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_0
TEXT: Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_1
TEXT: There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_2
TEXT: Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_3
TEXT: In any case, the time has come to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_4
TEXT: The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_0
TEXT: You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_1
TEXT: Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_1
TEXT: But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_2
TEXT: Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_3
TEXT: Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_4
TEXT: On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1
TEXT: I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_2
TEXT: As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_3
TEXT: That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_4
TEXT: So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_1
TEXT: Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_2
TEXT: Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_3
TEXT: While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_4
TEXT: Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_0
TEXT: I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_1
TEXT: All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_2
TEXT: Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_0
TEXT: I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_1
TEXT: But now, Giovanni is waiting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_2
TEXT: Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_3
TEXT: There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_1
TEXT: I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_2
TEXT: I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_3
TEXT: It may seem small, but every little bit helps!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3
TEXT: While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4
TEXT: The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_0
TEXT: As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1
TEXT: Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2
TEXT: It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3
TEXT: We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_4
TEXT: I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1
TEXT: I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2
TEXT: Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3
TEXT: Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0
TEXT: All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1
TEXT: Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2
TEXT: Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1
TEXT: It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3
TEXT: Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1
TEXT: Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2
TEXT: But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4
TEXT: I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1
TEXT: Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2
TEXT: But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3
TEXT: Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4
TEXT: And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1
TEXT: I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2
TEXT: Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3
TEXT: While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4
TEXT: I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1
TEXT: I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2
TEXT: Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3
TEXT: Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0
TEXT: You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1
TEXT: You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2
TEXT: Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3
TEXT: Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0
TEXT: Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1
TEXT: One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2
TEXT: This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3
TEXT: There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4
TEXT: For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0
TEXT: What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1
TEXT: Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2
TEXT: You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3
TEXT: But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1_alt
TEXT: I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2_alt
TEXT: You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1_alt
TEXT: Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_1
TEXT: While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_2
TEXT: Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_3
TEXT: While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_1
TEXT: Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_3
TEXT: While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_1
TEXT: As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_2
TEXT: Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_3
TEXT: We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_1
TEXT: I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_1
TEXT: The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_2
TEXT: So, until next time—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you looked up at the sky lately? I thought I’d been staring at reports for too long, but no, there are rainbows everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_1
TEXT: That’s not all—I’ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pokémon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_2
TEXT: In all seriousness, why don’t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_3
TEXT: Keep your eye on the sky, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket’s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pokémon for themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_1
TEXT: Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can’t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pokémon. It’s time to do some investigating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_2
TEXT: Knowing how large Team GO Rocket’s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pokémon in their wake. Let’s go catch some Shadow Pokémon and see where they lead us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_0
TEXT: Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_1
TEXT: ...and that it’s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon! But don’t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_2
TEXT: Let’s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh’s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_0
TEXT: Great job saving even more Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we’ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_1
TEXT: For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that’ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we’ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_1
TEXT: Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I’m certain you’ll come out on top—and save Ho-Oh to boot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_0
TEXT: What a magnificent battle, %PLAYERNAME%! Congrats on defeating Giovanni and saving Ho-Oh from his clutches.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_2
TEXT: With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pokémon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll see you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Glad you’re here. There’s something I could use your help with today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve been away for a while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been thinking about how to shake off the doldrums. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks—Pokémon research! Specifically, I’d like to learn about Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_3
TEXT: Roggenrola were first discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure, but the dirt that makes up their bodies is even older!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_4
TEXT: A Pokémon made of earth is just the thing to get me feeling grounded again, don’t you think? Not that I need an excuse to study Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_5
TEXT: Could you unearth some Roggenrola for me, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_0
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s get a closer look at those Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_1
TEXT: Hm... Did you notice the hexagonal cavities on their bodies? Those are their ears, and deep inside is an energy core that makes Roggenrola slightly warm to the touch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_2
TEXT: But don’t stick your hand inside the cavity—that’s a surefire way to get on their bad side, and fast!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_3
TEXT: Is that from firsthand experience, you ask? W-well, any researcher worth his salt has to take the occasional risk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_4
TEXT: You know, when Roggenrola evolve into Boldore and their energy is too great to be contained, they grow orange crystals on their bodies hard enough to smash diamonds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_5
TEXT: Doesn’t that sound like a sight, %PLAYERNAME%? Why don’t you help Roggenrola evolve so you can see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Boldore are looking great.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_1
TEXT: Their crystals—amazing! If only I had some diamonds to put that whole “smashing” thing to the proof.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_2
TEXT: Well, while we can’t conduct that particular experiment, I can still tell you more about Boldore.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_3
TEXT: Their crystals are actually masses of energy. Just one crystal fragment could provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_4
TEXT: *sigh* Yet another theory we can’t test ourselves. But if you help Boldore evolve, I’ll tell you all about what they do with that power, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_0
TEXT: There you have it, %PLAYERNAME%—a Gigalith of your own. Those crystals are even bigger now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_1
TEXT: When Gigalith’s orange crystals absorb solar energy, it’s magnified internally and fired from its mouth. It’s even capable of blowing away a mountain!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_2
TEXT: Because of its hefty horsepower, Gigalith is a popular partner for construction workers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure you and Gigalith will get along great too, seeing as you’re always out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_4
TEXT: At any rate, thanks for helping me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m feeling more like my old self already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_5
TEXT: Let’s do this again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0
TEXT: Aha! I hoped we’d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1
TEXT: I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees—something unusual.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2
TEXT: I can’t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pokémon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3
TEXT: Either way, would you keep an eye—or even two—out for any unusual Grass-type Pokémon while you’re exploring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1
TEXT: I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it’s definitely a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don’t you canvas the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3
TEXT: In the meantime, I’ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can’t confirm its identity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0
TEXT: Excellent, you’re back! I’ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1
TEXT: After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2
TEXT: They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3
TEXT: I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1
TEXT: When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2
TEXT: Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3
TEXT: You take care of that and let me know what you find. I’ll take some more time to study up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we’ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1
TEXT: I don’t think I have to remind you to be careful—it’s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pokémon fear it. But I’m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2
TEXT: Just treat it like any other Pokémon—approach with patience and an open heart. Then I’m sure you’ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_3
TEXT: Great work so far, and good luck with what’s to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_0
TEXT: Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_1
TEXT: I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_2
TEXT: Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_3
TEXT: Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_4
TEXT: But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_5
TEXT: The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_6
TEXT: It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_2
TEXT: When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_3
TEXT: Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_4
TEXT: It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_5
TEXT: In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_0
TEXT: As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_1
TEXT: A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_2
TEXT: Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_3
TEXT: I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_4
TEXT: According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_6
TEXT: You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn’t put it past you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_7
TEXT: Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_8
TEXT: I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_1
TEXT: It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_2
TEXT: Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_3
TEXT: Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_4
TEXT: What an amazing Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, glad I caught you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to warn you about the feathers you may have seen scattered around. If you’re considering picking one up—don’t. They’re surprisingly sharp. Trust me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_2
TEXT: I have a hypothesis about the identity of our feather flinger, but I’d love an extra set of eyes to confirm it. Could you poke around and let me know what you find?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_0
TEXT: Aha! I was right! These feathers belong to Rowlet, the Grass Quill Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_1
TEXT: As a Grass type, Rowlet use photosynthesis to store up energy during the day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_2
TEXT: Rowlet are typically active at night—thus my initial hesitancy to pin this loose plumage on them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_3
TEXT: Though delightfully round and known to cuddle up in Trainers’ backpacks, this Pokémon shouldn’t be underestimated. Rowlet has mastered the art of deftly launching dagger-sharp feathers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_4
TEXT: Certainly not a Pokémon whose feathers you want to ruffle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_5
TEXT: Consider my interest piqued! How about we see what we can learn about its Evolution next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_0
TEXT: Just look at that dashing Dartrix, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_1
TEXT: Dartrix is known to be a bit of a dandy. It never slacks when it comes to cleaning its feathers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_2
TEXT: Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its knife-like feathers—appropriately dubbed “blade quills”—nice and sharp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_3
TEXT: It throws these quills at its enemies, striking their weak points with remarkable precision.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_4
TEXT: Talk about “if looks could thrill”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_5
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and give evolving Dartrix a shot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_1
TEXT: Decidueye is an expert archer. It can nock and fire an arrow quill in a tenth of a second and pierce a pebble at distances over a hundred yards.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_2
TEXT: Despite its cool demeanor, when caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_3
TEXT: That happens to me from time to time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_4
TEXT: A colleague recently told me that Decidueye’s appearance may be influenced by its environment. Isn’t that fascinating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, thanks for indulging my curiosity today, %PLAYERNAME%. It’s always such a delight to research on the fly with you. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_1
TEXT: It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I’m sure your skills are as sharp as ever, but it couldn’t hurt to do a little warm-up anyway.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_2
TEXT: Why don’t you start by seeing what Pokémon are in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what you find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Back already, eh? Let’s take a look at the Pokémon you caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_1
TEXT: Hmm... Well done! I knew you wouldn’t have any problem getting back into the swing of things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_2
TEXT: This is a great start—so let’s keep going! Why don’t you head out and see what other Pokémon you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_3
TEXT: While you do, I’ll stay here and start researching the ones you caught already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_4
TEXT: I’m counting on you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your recent efforts, I’ve got plenty of research topics to keep me occupied—for now, anyway.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_2
TEXT: I’ll be sure to reach out whenever I need a hand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_3
TEXT: Until then, I hope you have a wonderful time exploring the world around you and meeting all sorts of incredible Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_4
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_0
TEXT: Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_1
TEXT: I’m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_2
TEXT: These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn’t fall.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_3
TEXT: Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_4
TEXT: How about you spend some time with them and see what they’re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I’d love to take a closer look at them—especially their shells.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that there’s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_2
TEXT: How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_3
TEXT: The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_5
TEXT: It’s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_6
TEXT: I’d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_0
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don’t they look like a tough bunch?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_1
TEXT: Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pokémon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_2
TEXT: On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_3
TEXT: But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_4
TEXT: They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_5
TEXT: Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight—befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_1
TEXT: Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_2
TEXT: The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_5
TEXT: I’ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_6
TEXT: And I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won’t be long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_7
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_searching_gold_june23_1_0
TEXT: Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve got a golden day of research ahead of us. I can’t wait to get started!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_searching_gold_june23_1_1
TEXT: Say, are you looking forward to finding one of these Pokémon? I’ve got a good feeling about them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, exciting news! In my recent research into other regions, I learned of Paldea—a vast, open place dotted with agricultural villages, port towns, and lively markets.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_1
TEXT: And beyond those settlements, Paldea has all sorts of magnificent places begging to be explored, from towering mountains to resplendent lakes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_2
TEXT: Most importantly for us, there are plenty of Pokémon first discovered in Paldea for us to study!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_3
TEXT: Doesn’t the very idea get your heart racing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_4
TEXT: If you’re up for it, I say we put our all-star teamwork to the proof by learning all there is to learn about them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_0
TEXT: Great choice! You know, Sprigatito’s a bit of a rascal. It’s capricious and attention-seeking, to the point that it may sulk if it sees you giving attention to another Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_1
TEXT: As for its physical characteristics, its fluffy fur is similar in composition to plants, letting it create energy by absorbing sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_2
TEXT: And when Sprigatito kneads and rubs with its forepaws, a sweet aroma is released that can mesmerize those around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_3
TEXT: While you contemplate that, how about you walk around and look for some Grass-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pokémon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here’s another fun Sprigatito fact.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_1
TEXT: Sprigatito washes its face regularly to keep its fur from drying out. What a great self-care regimen!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_2
TEXT: I wonder how Sprigatito’s Evolution, Floragato, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Sprigatito evolve so we can find out for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_0
TEXT: Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure there’s plenty you’ll learn with a Pokémon like Floragato at your side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that its fur can become softer or harder depending on its mood? It can even be needle sharp when Floragato is ready to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_2
TEXT: Speaking of battle, Floragato deftly wields a vine hidden beneath its long fur, slamming the hard flower bud against its opponents. I bet that smarts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how Floragato changes when it evolves into Meowscarada. Please come see me when it does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_4_0
TEXT: Whoa! Meowscarada is one a-meow-zing Pokémon! I’ve heard that with skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen-packed flower bombs, which it sets off before its foes realize what’s going on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_4_1
TEXT: That’s quite the magic trick. I hope to see it firsthand someday—from a safe distance, of course! But that’s enough out of me—you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_1_0
TEXT: Great choice! Fuecoco’s one cheerful little chomper. Flickering atop its head is fire energy that is leaking out from inside its body—and when Fuecoco gets excited, its head spouts more flames!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_1_1
TEXT: How about you match that enthusiasm as you walk around and look for Fire-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pokémon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here’s another fun Fuecoco fact.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_1
TEXT: Fuecoco lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_2
TEXT: I wonder how Fuecoco’s Evolution, Crocalor, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Fuecoco evolve so we can find out for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_0
TEXT: Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure there’s plenty you’ll learn with a Pokémon like Crocalor at your side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that the combination of Crocalor’s fire energy and overflowing vitality is what caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the Pokémon’s head?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, the valve in Crocalor’s flame sac is closely connected to its vocal cords. It utters a guttural cry as it spews flames every which way. Spicy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how Crocalor changes when it evolves into Skeledirge. Please come see me when it does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_0
TEXT: Whoa! Skeledirge is one sizzlingly slick Pokémon—and yet somehow so serene! I’ve heard that Skeledirge’s gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_1
TEXT: And yet it burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s, uh, certainly comforting to know you’re on the same team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_2
TEXT: But that’s enough out of me—you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_branch_0
TEXT: Which Pokémon first discovered in Paldea would you like to join you on your adventure, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_0
TEXT: Great choice! Quaxly is an earnest and tidy Pokémon. Perhaps you’re the sort of Trainer who likes it when everything is neatly in place—and for Quaxly, that place is at your side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_1
TEXT: Quaxly’s feathers secrete a gel that repels water and grime, so its body is always glossy. And get a gander at that coif atop its head! So luxurious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_2
TEXT: I’m suddenly inspired to tidy things up around here. While I’m doing that, why don’t you walk around and look for Water-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pokémon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here’s another fun Quaxly fact.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_1
TEXT: This Pokémon migrated to Paldea from distant lands long ago. Its strong legs let it easily swim around in even fast-flowing rivers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_2
TEXT: I wonder how Quaxly’s Evolution, Quaxwell, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Quaxly evolve so we can find out for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_0
TEXT: Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure there’s plenty you’ll learn with a Pokémon like Quaxwell at your side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that these Pokémon constantly run through shallow waters to train their legs, then compete with each other to see which of them kicks most gracefully?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_2
TEXT: The hardworking Quaxwell observes people and Pokémon from various regions and incorporates their movements into its own dance routines. So studious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how Quaxwell changes when it evolves into Quaquaval. Please come see me when it does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_4_0
TEXT: Whoa! Quaquaval is one mesmerizing Pokémon! This Pokémon uses its powerful legs to perform striking dances from far-off lands. And that’s not all those legs can do—I’ve heard that a single kick from a Quaquaval can send a truck rolling. Yikes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_4_1
TEXT: But that’s enough out of me—you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_2
TEXT: One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_3
TEXT: Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_4
TEXT: Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_5
TEXT: ...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_1
TEXT: There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_2
TEXT: My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_3
TEXT: This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_4
TEXT: Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_5
TEXT: For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_1
TEXT: And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_2
TEXT: Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_3
TEXT: Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_4
TEXT: Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_1
TEXT: I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_2
TEXT: Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_3
TEXT: You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_4
TEXT: It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_5
TEXT: For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6
TEXT: Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_7
TEXT: For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_0
TEXT: Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_1
TEXT: But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_2
TEXT: I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_3
TEXT: Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_4
TEXT: While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_5
TEXT: Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6
TEXT: I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_7
TEXT: Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1
TEXT: Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2
TEXT: Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4
TEXT: Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5
TEXT: Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6
TEXT: For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_0
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_1
TEXT: BOO! Haha, did I scare you? Not too badly, I hope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our investigation into these eerie events. Don’t worry—I won’t send you into any rickety mansions or foggy forests.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_3
TEXT: I was actually doing some research near a forest myself recently, and I found a rather odd-looking tree. I’ve learned over the years to trust my gut when something seems strange in the field—chances are it’s a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_4
TEXT: I couldn’t help but indulge my curiosity, and I stepped toward the tree to observe it more closely. As soon as I did, the tree pivoted on its roots and stared me down with a single red eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5
TEXT: It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_6
TEXT: It must have sensed that I was just there for research because it turned back around and ignored me. Its attention then turned to the many Phantump gathered around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_7
TEXT: That’s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pokémon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_9
TEXT: I have a feeling there’s more to Hoopa than its penchant for mischief. Maybe we’ll find some answers after we conduct some more research on Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_11_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! As we close out our spooky investigations, I have a feeling there are some bright things on the horizon for us to explore together soon. I’ll be sure to let you know when I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1
TEXT: If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2
TEXT: What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3
TEXT: Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4
TEXT: For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5
TEXT: But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1
TEXT: It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2
TEXT: Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1
TEXT: While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2
TEXT: I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3
TEXT: There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4
TEXT: You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5
TEXT: We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1
TEXT: Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2
TEXT: We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0
TEXT: As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1
TEXT: You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2
TEXT: I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_1
TEXT: Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_2
TEXT: Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_3
TEXT: It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up—but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn’t all bad.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_4
TEXT: It was nice having an excuse to clean—not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn’t it? I think it’s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that’s why it’s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_6
TEXT: Who knows—you might be able to catch it now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_1
TEXT: Normally I’d say we’re done with our research, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_2
TEXT: It seems there’s still much for us to learn about this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_3
TEXT: By the way, I’ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pokémon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa’s presence be the cause?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_4
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pokémon, including Hoopa. I’ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I’ll let you know when I’ve learned more. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pokémon appearing around my mobile lab of late.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_1
TEXT: Whenever something like this happens, I can’t help but get excited about researching the cause!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_2
TEXT: As you may recall, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pokémon in these parts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_3
TEXT: What’s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pokémon. There’s one in particular that’s caught my attention: Inkay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_4
TEXT: My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pokémon, and that it evolves in a unique way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_5
TEXT: I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying “upside-down” several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_6
TEXT: Maybe it’s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear “upside-down”—because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_0
TEXT: Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa’s brought some welcome color to our lives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_1
TEXT: Speaking of colorful things, I’ve heard reports that there’s a certain Pokémon nearby that’s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_2
TEXT: In the meantime, I’m going to analyze everything we’ve learned about Psychic-type Pokémon thus far. Hopefully it’ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pokémon forms—and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed that some Pokémon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn’t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_1
TEXT: Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pokémon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat—10 in all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_2
TEXT: Why don’t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows—maybe we’ll learn more about other Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_0
TEXT: Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pokémon that’re known to change their appearance? That includes one we’ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_1
TEXT: Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_2
TEXT: I wonder if we’ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_3
TEXT: In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We’re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can’t rule out Hoopa’s involvement.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_4
TEXT: Hoopa’s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it’ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_5
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s nice to see a friendly face—because I’ve been seeing a lot of spooky Pokémon staring at me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_1
TEXT: Do you think this might be Hoopa’s doing? Hoopa’s known to transport Pokémon and people to different places with its rings, so maybe that’s what’s happening here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_2
TEXT: After all those Legendary Pokémon appeared during this year’s GO Fest—as well as those Pokémon first found in Galar that appeared more recently—I’d say Hoopa’s involvement here is more than likely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_3
TEXT: Perhaps we can learn more about Hoopa by studying the Ghost-type Pokémon that have begun to show up nearby. Mind giving me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_0
TEXT: Thanks for conducting that research, Trainer. We certainly know more than we did, but not enough to explain why these spooky occurrences are still...well, occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_1
TEXT: Let’s do a bit more research on Ghost-type Pokémon then, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you and Rhi enough for bringing me back from beyond the Ultra Wormhole. The two of you are quite the team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_2
TEXT: As exhilarating as it was to explore a different dimension, it wasn’t without its challenges. Thoughts of home kept me calm—you, Meltan, the team leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_3
TEXT: Maybe it was the sheer strength of those memories, but more than once it seemed almost like I was being surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_4
TEXT: Who knows—maybe there really was something watching out for me! Our world can’t be the only one full of mysteries, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_5
TEXT: Speaking of mysteries, I have a new one to share with you, %PLAYERNAME%. Since my return, a small, gaseous Pokémon I’ve never seen before has been hanging around my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_6
TEXT: It seems friendly, but where did it come from?  Did it follow me from beyond the Ultra Wormhole? Could it be an Ultra Beast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_7
TEXT: Considering that possibility, I think it would be best if you work with Rhi to raise this Pokémon. Naturally, I’ll be eager to hear anything you may learn in the process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_0
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. So, Professor Willow confirmed he felt a presence like this Legendary Pokémon on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_1
TEXT: It would seem my theory was correct, then. A Pokémon of its kind protected Professor Willow during his disappearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_2
TEXT: Pokémon are such wonderful creatures. I will have to make note of this behavior.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_3
TEXT: You’re marvelous too, %PLAYERNAME%—a kind and strong Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_4
TEXT: I am at ease knowing that someone so capable is keeping an eye on the Ultra Beasts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_5
TEXT: And more importantly, I am honored to call someone like you a friend.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_6
TEXT: Ahem. Now, I believe a status report is in order.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_7
TEXT: This world is sufficiently capable of defending itself against threats from the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_8
TEXT: However, we have yet to discern the origin of—or inciting force behind—the Ultra Wormholes. I ran some tests as you conversed with Professor Willow and determined that our Pokémon friend here is not responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_9
TEXT: At least one mystery yet persists. It would seem more adventures lie on the horizon for us, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. With the Ultra Beasts presently at bay, now is an opportune moment to reflect on our time together thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_1
TEXT: The Ultra Wormholes and the dangers they pose were my primary concerns upon arriving in this world. But now, I find myself equally invested in developing our relationship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_2
TEXT: In light of our new rapport, perhaps it is time I reintroduced myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_3
TEXT: I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad. It is a pleasure to be your friend, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_4
TEXT: Is there any objective I may assist you with today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_5
TEXT: Your Professor Willow has asked us to rear and study a peculiar Pokémon, is it? Understood.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_6
TEXT: Ah. I have heard tales of such a Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_7
TEXT: Its gentle glow is impossible to mistake. I believe this Pokémon is called...Cosmog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_8
TEXT: Come—let us show Cosmog the beauty of this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_0
TEXT: Hm? You wish to know more of Cosmog?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_1
TEXT: Some have said that in ages past, it was known as the child of the stars.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_2
TEXT: Beyond that, few details are known.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_3
TEXT: Perhaps you and I can shed some light on this peculiar Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_4
TEXT: Earning its trust seems like a logical first step.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_5
TEXT: Do you think Cosmog would feel closer to us if it were given a nickname?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_6
TEXT: Its visage reminds me of outer space... A nebula, perhaps.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_7
TEXT: But never mind my musings. I will leave the decision to you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_8
TEXT: No matter the name, I am eager to learn more of Cosmog as we become better acquainted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you, as always.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_1
TEXT: How have you and Rhi been? Have you two learned any more about that mysterious Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_2
TEXT: Rhi recognizes it, you say? And its name is Cosmog? Incredible! Having a bit of extra-dimensional help really expands our knowledge base.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_3
TEXT: Still, when it comes to Pokémon research, nothing beats firsthand observation. Have you gleaned anything interesting during your time with Cosmog, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_4
TEXT: Hmm... I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_5
TEXT: Sounds like Cosmog’s curious, but not very cautious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_6
TEXT: I can relate to throwing caution to the wind, but when you’re light enough to be blown away by the slightest breeze... Well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_7
TEXT: It’s a good thing you and Rhi are there to make sure Cosmog is safe—just like you were for me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_8
TEXT: Anyhow, the more time you spend with Cosmog, the more we’ll learn. Let me know when you make more discoveries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. Greetings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_1
TEXT: So, Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_2
TEXT: Do not be troubled by its current state.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_3
TEXT: This is its natural biology at work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_4
TEXT: Though Cosmoem lies inert, energy is building within its core.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_5
TEXT: I suspect it is preparing to evolve and will become active again in due time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_6
TEXT: Precisely when that will happen is beyond my knowledge, however.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_7
TEXT: Once Cosmoem evolves, I wonder... Wait. I am struck by a thought. Recall how Willow spoke of a presence “warm like the sun and calm like the moon.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_8
TEXT: I apologize for the abrupt interruption of our conversation, %PLAYERNAME%, but I must make some notes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_9
TEXT: Please continue your exploration in my absence and apprise Professor Willow of Cosmog’s evolution into Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back already! How’s Cosmog—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_1
TEXT: Whoa! Who’s that Pokémon? Did Cosmog evolve?! Just look at that lustrous shell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_2
TEXT: Rhi’s hypothesis is that this “Cosmoem” will stay in this state until it’s ready to evolve? Excellent theory!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_3
TEXT: It’s definitely easier to get an up-close look at a Pokémon holding still, but what do you think is going on in Cosmoem’s mind? Is it asleep? Maybe it’s dreaming of adventuring with you and Rhi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_4
TEXT: What else will we learn once it “becomes active,” as Rhi put it? What kind of Pokémon could it become? Unlike our serene friend here, my mind’s buzzing with questions and possibilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_5
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what mysteries we’ll unravel, %PLAYERNAME%! Keep taking good care of Cosmoem until then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_6_0
TEXT: Still in a holding pattern with Cosmoem, %PLAYERNAME%? Not to worry—sometimes slow and steady is the way to go. I’ll be waiting right here, so come see me when you have an update to share.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_0
TEXT: Oh? Did you see that, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_1
TEXT: Cosmoem seems to be stirring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_2
TEXT: It appears the time has finally come.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_3
TEXT: We’ll soon be able to observe the splendor of Cosmoem evolving with our own eyes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_0
TEXT: In...incredible! Cosmoem has evolved!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_1
TEXT: Splendid! Scintillating, even—to witness such a stunning sight firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_2
TEXT: This Pokémon holds the power to open Ultra Wormholes. Others of its kind frequently join the GO Ultra Recon Squad in our investigations. They assist us in traversing dimensions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_3
TEXT: Though it remains to be seen how this particular specimen initially made its way here...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_4
TEXT: I’d like to observe how it acclimates to this world in its new form. Our friend has changed greatly since we first came across it as Cosmog. And you must show Professor Willow this dazzling development.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_5
TEXT: Do be sure to share his impressions with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you—and that majestic Pokémon you’ve brought with you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_1
TEXT: Unless I’ve gotten my wires crossed, I believe that’s a Legendary Pokémon originally discovered in Alola. How did you come across it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_2
TEXT: Wha—it evolved from Cosmoem?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_3
TEXT: I’m awestruck! And...struck with the exact same calm, warm feeling I had on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_4
TEXT: Hmm... Could a Pokémon of this species have been looking out for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_5
TEXT: Funny, isn’t it? I’m always thinking about how we can protect Pokémon. But it looks like this time, a Pokémon protected me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_6
TEXT: I’ve got one more friend to be thankful for, aside from you and Rhi.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_7
TEXT: I knew leaving Cosmog with you two was the right choice. With your encouragement and guidance, it’s become something truly Legendary!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_8
TEXT: Do me a favor, would you? Keep adventuring together and tell me all about your exploits when you have a chance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_9
TEXT: As for me, well... I think it’s about time I put my old lab coat back on. Don’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_1
TEXT: I’m so glad you’re here. Get this—there’ve been sightings of Shaymin in the area!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_2
TEXT: Well, it might be more accurate to say “potential sightings,” as I’ve yet to verify the information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_3
TEXT: Shaymin lives in common flower patches but is rarely noticed. It’s often mistaken for a flowering plant when curled up—what unique behavior for a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_4
TEXT: I can’t help but wonder if we’d know more about Shaymin if only we were a little more observant.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_5
TEXT: Let’s put that theory to the test and see what we can learn taking a good look around the area, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_0
TEXT: How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%? Any chance you ran into Shaymin while you were out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_1
TEXT: No? Well, that’s OK! I see you got some good snapshots of other Pokémon in the meantime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_2
TEXT: Hmm... That gets me thinking. As you might know, the flowers all over Shaymin burst into bloom if it’s lovingly hugged and senses gratitude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_3
TEXT: I hypothesize that if we take the time to share some thankfulness, we’ll attract Shaymin’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_4
TEXT: Not that we need any excuse to celebrate Pokémon, I say! In fact, how about we appreciate them in photo form with some more snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_0
TEXT: Your snapshots look great, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve got a real knack for catching Pokémon—both in Poké Balls and on camera!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_1
TEXT: And y’know what else you’ve got a knack for? Pokémon battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure you already know that one of the ways you can keep your team in tip-top shape is by powering up your Pokémon. Why don’t you do that and come see me when you’re done?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_1
TEXT: I was just thinking about Shaymin again. One of the many things that makes Shaymin so special is that it has two known forms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_2
TEXT: I refer, of course, to its Land Forme and Sky Forme. Land Forme Shaymin is Grass-type, but when it turns into Sky Forme Shaymin, it becomes Grass- and Flying-type.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_3
TEXT: Some say that it transforms when it takes in the scent of a rare flower.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_4
TEXT: Perhaps you’re wondering what would happen if a human took a whiff. A researcher from long ago tried just that, but alas, his body remained unchanged.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_5
TEXT: Ah well. Not all hypotheses hold water. That’s just part of the scientific process!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_6
TEXT: And speaking of learning, why don’t you spend some time with other Grass-type Pokémon and Flying-type Pokémon? Maybe they’ll inspire you to make some hypotheses of your own!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Now you’ve got even more Pokémon to bring along on your journey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_1
TEXT: In the spirit of Shaymin being the Gratitude Pokémon, let’s show some gratitude to our old and newfound friends alike.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_2
TEXT: How about taking some snapshots with your Pokémon or feeding them some tasty Berries? I know my beloved Meltan always enjoys a snack—maybe your Pokémon are the same!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_0
TEXT: Your Pokémon are positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure they appreciated that extra quality time with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_1
TEXT: The more time I spend with Pokémon, the more I appreciate all their unique qualities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_2
TEXT: For example, Torchic is oh-so-cuddly. It has fire burning inside it, so hugging it is lovely and warm. Then there’s Mudkip, who contains amazing power—it can crush rocks bigger than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_3
TEXT: I could also wax poetic about Treecko, whose feet are covered by countless tiny spikes, enabling it to walk on walls and ceilings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_4
TEXT: And that’s just a scant three Pokémon! I’d love to hear your observations too, %PLAYERNAME%. What unique Pokémon and traits can you observe?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Yay—it’s Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_1
TEXT: It looks happy—I daresay even grateful—to be in the care of an exemplary Trainer like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_2
TEXT: And as long as we’re on the subject, I want you to know I’m incredibly thankful you helped me with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_3
TEXT: I know it’s not always easy, but I can’t tell you enough how much I appreciate your contributions to my studies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_4
TEXT: Studies that never end, I might add. Haha. So rest up, and I’ll be in contact again soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_5
TEXT: Let’s GO...with gratitude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you’ve been well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1
TEXT: The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2
TEXT: I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3
TEXT: How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0
TEXT: Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1
TEXT: Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2
TEXT: Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3
TEXT: Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4
TEXT: Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5
TEXT: Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2
TEXT: So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3
TEXT: I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0
TEXT: Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1
TEXT: But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2
TEXT: What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3
TEXT: Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It is fortunate you are here. Alarming events have transpired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_1
TEXT: As I was observing a slow, pink Pokémon, its tail suddenly fell off. I stooped down to pick up the tail, only to discover that the field was covered in more of these detached appendages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_2
TEXT: The Pokémon in question did not seem perturbed. However, I am. Could a disease be ailing the Pokémon? Are the fallen extremities separate life-forms?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_3
TEXT: Please assist me in assessing the situation, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you and Rhi running around earlier. What’ve you been up to?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_1
TEXT: There were Pokémon with their tails falling off? That does sound concerning, but I’ve got a hunch there’s nothing to worry about. Let me have a look!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_2
TEXT: Hmm... Yep! You’ll both be relieved to know these are just Slowpoke tails. Their tails fall off naturally. The Slowpoke don’t feel any pain when it happens, and their tails grow back, so they aren’t particularly bothered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_3
TEXT: Speaking of their tails, did you know that because Galarian Slowpoke eat the seeds of a plant that grows only in Galar, their tails have developed a spicy flavor?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_4
TEXT: So I hear, at least—I’ve never tasted one myself. Ooh, maybe we should have a picnic sometime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_5
TEXT: Ahem. Lunch plans aside, I’ll let Rhi know that there’s no cause for concern. Spend more time with the Slowpoke till I’m back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Whoa! Not only have you spent more time with Slowpoke, but you’ve helped some evolve, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_1
TEXT: Slowpoke’s pretty special. Not only can it evolve into one of two different Pokémon—Slowbro and Slowking—but each of its Evolutions has regional variants, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_2
TEXT: Slowpoke become Water- and Psychic-type Slowbro when Shellder latch on to their tails. Though usually dim-witted, they seem to become inspired if those Shellder bite down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_3
TEXT: Galarian Slowbro, unlike their non-Galarian counterparts, are Poison types.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_4
TEXT: When a Shellder bites one of them, it sets off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro’s body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pokémon. Pretty wild, huh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_5
TEXT: Evolve a couple more Slowpoke, and I’ll have some fun facts about Slowking to share when you’re back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_0
TEXT: Back so soon, %PLAYERNAME%? You’re faster than a Slowpoke, that’s for sure! Now for those Slowking facts I promised you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_1
TEXT: Slowking undertake research every day in an effort to solve the mysteries of the world. They have incredible intellect and intuition. Whatever the situation, they remain calm and collected.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_2
TEXT: Galarian Slowking, on the other hand, have something of a spooky bent. While chanting strange spells, these Pokémon combine their internal toxins with what they’ve eaten, creating strange potions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_3
TEXT: What do you think would happen if I drank one of those potions? Maybe I’d turn into a Slowking myself. Who knows what I could accomplish with their level of intellect!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_4
TEXT: Ah... You’re right, it might be hard for me to communicate like that. Either way, there’s no end to the discoveries we can make about Pokémon together—even if my noggin remains Shellder-free! Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_5
TEXT: The curiosity of friends like you and Rhi will take us far. I hope you two learned something today. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1
TEXT: I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2
TEXT: But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5
TEXT: They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6
TEXT: Good luck out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1
TEXT: I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2
TEXT: These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3
TEXT: They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4
TEXT: While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5
TEXT: Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1
TEXT: Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3
TEXT: Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4
TEXT: Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1
TEXT: It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2
TEXT: Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_0_0
TEXT: Hey! %PLAYERNAME%! No time to explain—take this Incubator and follow me, quick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_0
TEXT: Phew! Appreciate the hustle, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you use that Incubator I gave you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_1
TEXT: I bet you’re curious why we’re in a hurry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_2
TEXT: It’s because Elekid ran off—right as I took my eyes off it to put an Egg in that Incubator!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_3
TEXT: To be fair, this isn’t the first time my Elekid’s gotten a case of the zoomies. I think it just gets restless sometimes. And hey, chasing after it is a great way to get my daily steps in!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_4
TEXT: As for that Incubator, I had a feeling you’d be up for helping me track down Elekid and thought, “Why not hatch an Egg along the way?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_5
TEXT: Professor Willow tells me you’re no stranger to hatching Pokémon. I’d love to hear all about your escapades, so c’mon, dish!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_6
TEXT: Actually, hold that thought—I think I see Elekid over thataway! After it, %PLAYERNAME%! We can chat on the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_0
TEXT: Wanna hear more about what I’ve been up to?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_1
TEXT: Okay, so, I had this wild idea that exposing Pokémon Eggs to different kinds of music might influence what interests they develop as they grow up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_2
TEXT: No results yet, but I’ve been making a lotta playlists. Ooh, you should share some of your favorite tunes with me later!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_3
TEXT: I’m getting excited. Haha. Thinking about Pokémon always amps me up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_4
TEXT: Like, how do they instinctively develop so many unique characteristics? And at the same time, they all have their own personalities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_5
TEXT: For example, Elekid are known to rotate their arms to generate electricity, but they supposedly tire easily. And then there’s my Elekid, who’s always running off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_6
TEXT: That’s what makes my buddy so charming, though! I wouldn’t have it any other way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_7
TEXT: What’s your Buddy Pokémon like, %PLAYERNAME%? You should ask it to join us while we track down Elekid. I’m itching to see if your buddy’s personality is anything like yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_0
TEXT: A-HA! Elekid spotted dead ahead! And it looks like it’s tuckered itself out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_1
TEXT: Our wild Pokémon chase is finally coming to an end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_2
TEXT: Y’know, I bet things only went as smoothly as they did because you were here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_3
TEXT: I didn’t even have to worry about Team GO Rocket trying to mess with us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_4
TEXT: Come to think of it, they’ve been weirdly preoccupied lately... But hey, I’m not about to look a gift Horsea in the mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_5
TEXT: Enough about them, though. Thanks again for being my hero today, %PLAYERNAME%! I dunno how long it would’ve taken me to chase down Elekid without your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_6
TEXT: Well, I’ve got places to be and Eggs to hatch, but don’t be a stranger! Let’s chat again real soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2
TEXT: Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3
TEXT: When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4
TEXT: They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1
TEXT: According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2
TEXT: In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1
TEXT: I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3
TEXT: My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4
TEXT: Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0
TEXT: You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2
TEXT: Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1
TEXT: As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2
TEXT: Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3
TEXT: When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4
TEXT: I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1
TEXT: I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1
TEXT: I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2
TEXT: I'll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! I was walking through a forest earlier and saw something amazing—fountains of water, coming out of a river!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_1
TEXT: At first, I wondered who would install a fountain in the middle of nature.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_2
TEXT: But I saw the flash of a shell, and I realized our mystery architect must be a Squirtle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_3
TEXT: Squirtle hide in their shells to protect themselves, then strike with spouts of water at every opportunity. That must’ve been what I saw!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_4
TEXT: Squirtle is also known as a Pokémon that aspiring Trainers from the Kanto region can choose to be their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you have a look at the Tiny Turtle Pokémon yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were observing Squirtle, I happened upon a Wartortle with algae growing out of its shell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_1
TEXT: Wartortle is Squirtle’s Evolution. Ones with algae on their shells are very old, so imagine what that venerable Wartortle must have seen in its years!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_2
TEXT: Why don’t you evolve one of your Squirtle? It’ll be able to keep you company for a good long while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I wasn’t exaggerating when I said Wartortle could keep you company for a long time—they’re said to live for 10,000 years!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_1
TEXT: Their furry tails are a symbol of longevity and become deeper in color as Wartortle age.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_2
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? It’s the opposite of humans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_3
TEXT: And Wartortle don’t just have incredible endurance—they can also grow even stronger. When they evolve into Blastoise, they grow rocket cannons on their shells!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_4
TEXT: If you evolve a Wartortle, you can see it for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_0
TEXT: Look at the rocket cannons on that Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%! As you can see, Blastoise has spouts extending from the top of its shell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_1
TEXT: Once Blastoise takes aim at an enemy, it can blast out water with more force than a fire hose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_2
TEXT: That might be a fun way to cool down during a scorching summer, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_3
TEXT: Blastoise would have to hold back in a pool party, though—some researchers say the jets of water from Blastoise’s rocket cannons can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_4
TEXT: But with a Trainer like you, I’m sure everything will be under control, whether you and your Blastoise are out for some summer fun or engaged in a fierce battle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_5
TEXT: And speaking of summer fun, I’ve got to get the inflatable pool set up for Meltan. Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you have a blast!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have arrived at a convenient time. I would like you to assist me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_1
TEXT: I am only beginning to grow familiar with the sounds of this world. The rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_2
TEXT: But today I hear a new—there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_3
TEXT: That high-pitched chattering and stirring of air. Is it some sort of natural phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_4
TEXT: So you believe it to be caused by Pokémon. Intriguing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_5
TEXT: I am eager to locate the source. Let us proceed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_0
TEXT: So the multitude of Starly are the source of this cacophony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_1
TEXT: Though diminutive, they flap their wings with great power. And when they form a flock...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_2
TEXT: I would not wish to be the target of their displeasure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_3
TEXT: The strength of such a small creature is a marvel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_4
TEXT: And if it were to evolve, I suspect that strength would only grow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_5
TEXT: Evolution affects Pokémon in such splendid ways. How will Starly change, do you think? Not another head, surely?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_6
TEXT: After our experience with Deino, little would surprise me. Nevertheless, I would like to witness this transformation for myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_0
TEXT: I am impressed yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_1
TEXT: Staravia might not have grown an additional head, but it did increase in size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_2
TEXT: My early observations indicate that Staravia, too, prefer to travel in a flock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_3
TEXT: And when Staravia are not surrounded by their kind, they cry noisily. Perhaps they find comfort and security when together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_4
TEXT: I...can understand this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_5
TEXT: Ahem. Does it evolve further? What changes might that bring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_0
TEXT: Stunning. What a formidable physique.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_1
TEXT: This musculature of this Pokémon—Staraptor, is it?—indicates great strength. It appears more than capable of carrying away its prey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_2
TEXT: And, unlike Starly and Staravia, it appears not to travel in flocks. Curious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_3
TEXT: The Pokémon of this world have such fascinating social structures. Some are more comfortable with others, and some find contentment alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_4
TEXT: They are like humans in this way, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_5
TEXT: With each investigation we undertake, my understanding of your world is further illuminated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_6
TEXT: Thank you for your company, Pokémon Trainer. Until again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5
TEXT: Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5
TEXT: You truly are an incredible Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_1
TEXT: Have you noticed all the Swinub out today? I wonder if there’s something they find enticing buried around here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_2
TEXT: After all, Swinub rub their snouts on the ground to find and dig up food. Their favorite food is mushrooms that grow under dead grass.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_3
TEXT: In fact, in ancient times, the people of Hisui relied on this skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_4
TEXT: Best we don’t interrupt any Swinub mid-snuffle, but we can still spend some time observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_0
TEXT: You’re right, some mushroom soup does sound good, Meltan—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_1
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back! Though I should’ve heard you coming with those sniffing Swinub behind you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_2
TEXT: Swinub’s Evolution, Piloswine, also has a sensitive nose. And their thick coat of long hair helps them endure freezing cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_3
TEXT: Sounds cozy, doesn’t it? Maybe I should take a hint and grow my beard out during the winter months...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_4
TEXT: Ahem. You’re right—I’m sure their hair is different from mine. The cold is nothing a good parka can’t fix, anyway!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_5
TEXT: Let’s have a look at Piloswine in person.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_0
TEXT: Is that a walking coat or a Piloswine, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_1
TEXT: Aw, not even a chuckle? I didn’t expect my joke to get such a chilly reception! Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_2
TEXT: I’ll make it up to you with a cool fact—Piloswine’s Evolution, Mamoswine, has tusks made of ice! As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks grow longer, thicker, and more impressive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_3
TEXT: What do you think Mamoswine’s tusks will look like on a day like this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Mamoswine’s tusks really are impressive!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_1
TEXT: It’s hard to imagine anything could get the better of a Pokémon this sturdy. In fact, this Pokémon has been around a long, looong time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_2
TEXT: I recently read that a frozen Mamoswine was dug up from soil dating back 10,000 years ago. And it woke up, to my amazement!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_3
TEXT: In a way, seeing a Mamoswine today is like looking back in time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_4
TEXT: What other Pokémon that we see today were also around then? How have they changed?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_5
TEXT: All fascinating questions that require further research to answer. But what we’ve observed of Swinub, Piloswine, and Mamoswine today is a great start.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_6
TEXT: Think on it as you go about the rest of your day, and come back soon to tell me your theories! But until then, thanks for spending the day with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_7
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_2
TEXT: The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_3
TEXT: My buddy is the Mythical Pokémon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I’ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me—there’s a lot to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_4
TEXT: I’ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you’ll run into one on your adventures?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_5
TEXT: Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let’s stock up on some supplies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you’re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don’t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_1
TEXT: Known as the Transport Pokémon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_2
TEXT: Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_3
TEXT: That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_4
TEXT: Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_5
TEXT: At any rate, let’s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pokémon to learn more about the Pokémon that Blanche holds dear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pokémon. Now, let’s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_2
TEXT: The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pokémon that hatch from Eggs, so it’s only natural that he’d have a buddy like Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_3
TEXT: But don’t let this Pokémon’s small stature fool you! Spark’s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_4
TEXT: Why hasn’t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_5
TEXT: I’m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_6
TEXT: Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pokémon than him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_7
TEXT: What do you say we research some Electric-type Pokémon that Spark tends to work with?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_0
TEXT: How did your research go, Trainer? I think it’s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pokémon—specifically the Fire Horse Pokémon Rapidash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_1
TEXT: This Pokémon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_2
TEXT: Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_3
TEXT: Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pokémon has plenty of time and space to do just that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_4
TEXT: That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_5
TEXT: Candela’s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members—and everyone, really.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_6
TEXT: Maybe researching Fire-type Pokémon will help you learn more about Candela’s fiery spirit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about the Pokémon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it’s time to do some research on my Buddy Pokémon: Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_2
TEXT: I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I’d never seen a Pokémon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_3
TEXT: The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we’ve been together ever since!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_4
TEXT: At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we’re practically inseparable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_5
TEXT: Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me—we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_6
TEXT: Let’s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_0
TEXT: Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_1
TEXT: I’m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_2
TEXT: Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_3
TEXT: But I’m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pokémon—whether it be Meltan or any other Pokémon that you feel a special bond with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_4
TEXT: After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pokémon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_5
TEXT: I’ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pokémon will achieve some incredible things—and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_6
TEXT: Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_1
TEXT: You know, I thought I smelled something sweet in the air today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_2
TEXT: Did I spill Berry juice again, you ask? You wound me, %PLAYERNAME%! As if I’d ruin this snazzy new jacket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_3
TEXT: Heh. In all seriousness, the smell was coming from outside.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_4
TEXT: Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to track down the source of the scent. But now that you’re here, maybe you can sniff it out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Seeing as you’ve got Teddiursa with you, I think I can connect the dots on what I was smelling earlier—honey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_1
TEXT: Teddiursa likes to lick its palms after soaking them in honey, so it’s no wonder I caught a whiff.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_2
TEXT: That reminds me of a fun fact about Teddiursa’s Evolution, Ursaring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_3
TEXT: With its ability to distinguish any aroma, Ursaring unfailingly finds all food buried deep underground. If only it was that easy for me to find lunch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_4
TEXT: Why don’t you help Teddiursa evolve so you can see Ursaring’s sleuthing skills for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_0
TEXT: I thought I heard something stomping about, and here you are, Ursaring in tow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_1
TEXT: Here’s the thing about Ursaring—although it has a large body, it’s quite skilled at climbing trees. It eats and sleeps in the treetops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_2
TEXT: Ah, to be an Ursaring... Imagine how much easier that’d make fieldwork—or picking Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_3
TEXT: Ahem. Snacks aside, have you noticed there’s a full moon out early today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_4
TEXT: Looks like Ursaring is staring at it, too. Think you can find out why, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_0
TEXT: Whoa! Could that be—Ursaluna?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_1
TEXT: I’ve never seen one in these parts. What an incredible find! Hmm...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_2
TEXT: Maybe in the Hisui region of long ago, where Ursaluna was first discovered, the full moon played a part in how Ursaring evolved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_3
TEXT: It’s theorized that Hisui's swampy terrain gave Ursaluna its burly physique and ability to manipulate peat at will.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_4
TEXT: What kind of food would suit a Pokémon accustomed to living in swamps? Grains? Beans? Cake?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_5
TEXT: Maybe I should get baking for some firsthand taste-testing. I bet Teddiursa could lend me some honey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_6
TEXT: Ah—listen to me yammering on and on. Researching Pokémon first found in Hisui never fails to pique my curiosity about the past!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_7
TEXT: Thanks again for spending the day learning about Pokémon with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I can always count on you to make my work a little sweeter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do you have anything fun planned for today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_1
TEXT: I’ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_2
TEXT: I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela’s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_3
TEXT: Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_4
TEXT: And suddenly—inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_5
TEXT: The Fire Pig Pokémon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_6
TEXT: Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don’t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don’t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_1
TEXT: Ah, I see you’ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_2
TEXT: Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_3
TEXT: When Pignite’s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_4
TEXT: Oh! That reminds me—I need to check on my roasted Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_5
TEXT: While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don’t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_1
TEXT: Just when I thought Pokémon couldn’t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_2
TEXT: Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pokémon called Emboar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_3
TEXT: Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It’s also known to care deeply about its friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_4
TEXT: Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I’ll be on my way soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_5
TEXT: How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I’d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_1
TEXT: This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pokémon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_2
TEXT: According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_3
TEXT: And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_4
TEXT: Haha, only joking! I’m sure I’d find it far too itchy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_6
TEXT: Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It’s always a joy to see how much you’ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_7
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows—maybe even some recipes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_8
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_0
TEXT: Rrrgh... Eight, nine, ten... Phew! Oh, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You caught me right at the end of my workout!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_1
TEXT: Being a Pokémon Professor’s not just about using your noodle—I’d argue it requires a strong body as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_2
TEXT: I’m feeling even more inspired than usual to stay fit thanks to the recent inflex—er, inFLUX of burly-looking Timburr.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_3
TEXT: Despite their smallish stature, these Pokémon can lift and carry some serious lumber. They love helping out with construction projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_4
TEXT: Why don’t you go catch a few Timburr so we can see their strength in action?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_0
TEXT: Great work catching those Timburr, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_1
TEXT: Check out how easily they carry those squared logs! Did you know Timburr carry bigger and bigger logs as they grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_2
TEXT: In fact, they love helping with construction so much that when rain causes work to stop, Timburr’s mood gets a bit...stormy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_3
TEXT: It’ll swing its log around and throw a tantrum!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_4
TEXT: Say, a few of your Timburr look like they’re carrying some pretty big logs. I think they might be ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_5
TEXT: Why don’t you help them out and show me when you’re done, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_0
TEXT: Wow! Get a load of those Gurdurr!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_1
TEXT: Gurdurr take great pride in their awe-inspiring muscles, and like to show them off to Machoke and other Gurdurr.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_2
TEXT: It’s so strong that even a group of wrestlers can’t make it budge an inch! Now that’s a fitness goal I’d like to hit one day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_3
TEXT: One thing to note is that unlike Timburr, Gurdurr’s strength is best applied to demolition rather than construction. They skillfully wield steel beams to take down buildings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_4
TEXT: Gurdurr evolves into quite the fascinating Pokémon as well. Why don’t you help one evolve so we can observe it more closely?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_0
TEXT: Great job evolving your Gurdurr into Conkeldurr, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_1
TEXT: Rather than relying on sheer force, Conkeldurr takes a more sophisticated approach to battle. Did you notice those concrete pillars it uses as walking canes?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_2
TEXT: Conkeldurr spins those around and uses centrifugal force to defeat its opponents.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_3
TEXT: Conkeldurr’s mastery of concrete is well documented. Some of my colleagues believe that Conkeldurr actually taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_4
TEXT: Somehow, the concrete that Conkeldurr mixes is more durable than what humans can create.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_5
TEXT: There’s so much more to this Pokémon than meets the eye—truly an inspiration to those of us who aim to sharpen both our minds and bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_6
TEXT: And with our research finished for the day, I’d say it’s time for my cooldown lap. Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_0
TEXT: There you are! I had a feeling I’d see you today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_1
TEXT: Look at all the Togetic fluttering around. I’ve never seen so many at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_2
TEXT: Togetic is said to be a Pokémon that brings good fortune, and what better fortune could I have than running into you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_3
TEXT: Let’s see what other good things lie in store for us as we continue observing these Togetic.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_0
TEXT: Your Togetic is positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! Could that glow be from Togetic’s distinctive joy dust?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_1
TEXT: You see, research says that Togetic appear in front of kindly people to scatter a glowing down called “joy dust,” showering them with happiness.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_2
TEXT: What practical applications could there be for joy dust? Will Pokémon and humans feel joy upon seeing it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_3
TEXT: We researchers have yet to answer these questions. Just thinking of the possibilities is filling me with happiness!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_4
TEXT: But first things first. A kindhearted Trainer—or Professor—doesn’t forget to take care of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_5
TEXT: Let’s share some happiness with Togetic by feeding them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_0
TEXT: Nice work, %PLAYERNAME%. Those Togetic look positively jubilant.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_1
TEXT: Speaking of being jubilant, let me tell you about Togetic’s Evolution, Togekiss! It’s also known as the Jubilee Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_2
TEXT: Togekiss share their many blessings with people who respect one another’s rights and avoid needless strife. It sounds like quite the wonderful Pokémon to have around.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_3
TEXT: I bet you’d have no trouble evolving Togetic into a Togekiss of your own. Why not give it a try?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_0
TEXT: Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve evolved Togetic into your very own Togekiss!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_1
TEXT: These Pokémon are never seen anywhere near conflict or turmoil. It’s been depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_2
TEXT: Speaking of bygone times, a researcher from long ago wrote, “After studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns over the land.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_3
TEXT: I know I’m filled with peace and happiness whenever you reveal yourself to help with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for spending another day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_0
TEXT: Perfect timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve got an electrifying adventure lined up for you today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been monitoring some nearby waters and have picked up intriguing electrical signals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_2
TEXT: If my hunch is correct, we’ve got a school of the Electric-type Pokémon Tynamo on our hands! Well, maybe not literally on our hands—they’re pretty zappy—but you know what I mean.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_3
TEXT: See if you can spot any Tynamo out there. Even better if you can bring one back for us to study up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see I was right to charge you with researching Tynamo today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_1
TEXT: I just learned that one Tynamo alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_2
TEXT: And things get even more shocking once Tynamo evolves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Tynamo into Eelektrik so we can study it together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektrik has me en-wrap-tured! Get it? Because they coil around their prey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_1
TEXT: Anyway... If you look closely, you can see these circular patterns along Eelektrik’s body are actually electricity-generating organs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_2
TEXT: That’s why I always pack a pair of rubber gloves. You never know when you’ll be handling Electric-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_3
TEXT: Now, I think you’re ready to take this research up a notch and evolve your Eelektrik into Eelektross!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_0
TEXT: Wow! What an achievement, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektross has me totally amped!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Eelektross’ fangs have electricity running through them? It makes me glad I didn’t become a Pokémon dentist! Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_2
TEXT: The fact that you’ve befriended such a phenomenal Electric-type Pokémon is grounds for celebration, I say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_3
TEXT: Keep up the fantastic work out there. I’m sure I’ll see you again soon. Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is excellent. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_2
TEXT: You see, I’m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I’ve yet to suss out why they’ve been appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_3
TEXT: I can only hope they’re not angry with us—or worse!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It’s important to give your brain a breather now and then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve found some leafy Pokémon to rest under.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_1
TEXT: Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_2
TEXT: While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We’ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_4
TEXT: Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5
TEXT: Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula’Ula Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_6
TEXT: Ula’Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_7
TEXT: Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn’t be too hard to find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_8
TEXT: In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we’ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pokémon that are known to grow. Let’s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—you’re back. How did your search go?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_1
TEXT: I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_2
TEXT: And just a few minutes later, before I’d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she’d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_3
TEXT: Yet another guardian deity I’ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pokémon research, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_4
TEXT: I’m glad you’ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it’s out there, let’s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_5
TEXT: I’ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%—you saw Tapu Bulu, didn’t you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_1
TEXT: What was it like? Tell me everything! Did you hear a ringing noise? Did you see it making vegetation grow, or maybe even swinging large trees around by their roots?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_2
TEXT: Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_3
TEXT: As you might’ve expected, I was—yet again—unable to witness Tapu Bulu myself. I did, however, think up a new theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_4
TEXT: The guardian deities seem to be keeping a relatively low profile. Perhaps they’re just here to investigate something—or even help us somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_5
TEXT: Things may become clearer if we see Tapu Fini, the last of Alola’s guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_6
TEXT: For now, though, I think we’ve earned some rest. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_1
TEXT: What a lovely day! But it looks like there’s pollen in the ah...ah...ah-choo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_2
TEXT: Shame it’s garden-variety pollen and not healing pollen from the Flabébé I’ve seen around.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_3
TEXT: I wish I were as carefree as the Flabébé seem to be! With their untroubled hearts, I wonder what Flabébé wish for...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_4
TEXT: Sorry, I got lost in my daydreams! What about you, %PLAYERNAME%? What’s your research wish today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_0
TEXT: Zzz... Bwuh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_1
TEXT: Oh! Sorry about that, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_2
TEXT: I’m *yawn* running on very little sleep. Candela gave me some of the coffee beans she’s been raving about, so I did the neighborly thing and gave ’em a whirl.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_3
TEXT: The coffee was delicious, but WAY stronger than I’m used to. It kept me wide awake into the wee hours of the night.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_4
TEXT: Getting a good amount of sleep is essential if you want to keep your brain sharp. Speaking personally, exhaustion tends to steer me toward more...outlandish theories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_5
TEXT: Hm? You want to hear one? Well...all right. But let’s keep it between us, OK?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_6
TEXT: Somewhere on my desk there’s an early draft of a paper called “The Aerodynamics of Various Hats as Worn by Pikachu.” It’s very well researched, I assure you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_7
TEXT: But that’s enough about me. Do you have any theories of your own you’d like to explore?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_0_8
TEXT: Why don’t you sleep on it and get back to me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_0
TEXT: Ah—hello, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_1
TEXT: Candela’s extra-strength coffee is finally out of my system, so I’m back to snoozing like a Snorlax—and thinking up more promising ideas for papers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_2
TEXT: “The Effects of Elevation on Snorlax Snoring Patterns” is going to be a hit, I just know it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_3
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? Feeling refreshed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_4
TEXT: I’m sure whatever you’ve thought up over the last few days is more than worthy of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_waina_temp_1_5
TEXT: Now get out there and seize the day—and remember to get a good night’s sleep!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_winter_wishes_1_0
TEXT: Brrr... Ah! %PLAYERNAME%! Did you notice the snow we’ve been getting? It’s beautiful—and freezing! I feel colder than a Bergmite!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_winter_wishes_1_1
TEXT: Winter is a time for wishing, and while a Bergmite might wish for the weather to stay like this forever, I’m wishing for an extra layer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_winter_wishes_1_2
TEXT: What about you, %PLAYERNAME%? What’s your winter research wish?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve discovered some tracks nearby that could only belong to one Pokémon—Wooper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_1
TEXT: While Wooper are generally aquatic, they do brave the shore when searching for food.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_2
TEXT: It’s also possible that the tracks I found belong to Paldean Wooper, who live on land!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_3
TEXT: No matter which of the two has been squelching around the area, this presents an exciting opportunity to observe these charming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_4
TEXT: What do you say? Shall we try “tracking” them down?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_0_5
TEXT: Then let’s get our galoshes on and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_0
TEXT: Goodness, %PLAYERNAME%—I’d hoped to find either Wooper or Paldean Wooper, but both? What an unexpected delight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_1
TEXT: I’m thrilled to get this opportunity to research the two’s similarities and differences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_2
TEXT: Though a word of caution before you get too friendly—Wooper covers itself with a gooey, toxic film while walking on land to keep its skin from dehydrating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_3
TEXT: The same goes for Paldean Wooper.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_4
TEXT: That’s why we’ll need to be careful with our hands-on—or in this case, hands-off—research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_1_5
TEXT: I think our next steps should be to finish up our initial observations and help some Wooper evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_0
TEXT: Fantastic work as usual, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_1
TEXT: As you’ve just discovered, Wooper evolves into Quagsire, whereas Paldean Wooper evolves into Clodsire.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_2
TEXT: Quagsire are known to be easygoing—so much that they couldn’t care less when they bump their heads on boulders and boats while swimming!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_3
TEXT: Your Quagsire looks particularly carefree. It must know it’s in the best possible hands with you as its Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_4
TEXT: Did you know that when it’s time for Quagsire to eat, it lies at a river’s bottom, waiting for prey to stray into its mouth?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_5
TEXT: Thankfully, it doesn’t get hungry often, since it doesn’t move much! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_6
TEXT: Now, we’ve learned plenty about Quagsire, so let’s turn our attention to Paldean Wooper’s Evolution, Clodsire. Think you can bring one to me, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Let’s take a closer look at Clodsire.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_1
TEXT: Clodsire are known to carry Wooper on their backs, ferrying them across water from one shore to the other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_2
TEXT: But if Clodsire is provoked, it sticks thick spines out from its body. Let’s...take care not to startle them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_3
TEXT: Phew! What an exciting day. My coat is caked with mud, but it was worth it to get some up-close research time with these intriguing Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for all your help braving the muddy unknown, %PLAYERNAME%. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_0_1
TEXT: I need help with—you guessed it—research! But this isn’t work that you can do alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_0_2
TEXT: Try joining a party so you can go on an adventure with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_0_3
TEXT: You might even make a new friend along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you enjoyed spending time with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_1
TEXT: Now, let’s take a look at the Pokémon you caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_2
TEXT: Excellent! You’ve accomplished great things while working together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_3
TEXT: In fact, I’ll bet teamwork is the key to advancing our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_4
TEXT: Why don’t you join other Trainers on another adventure? I can’t wait to see what Pokémon you’ll find together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Back from your adventure?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_1
TEXT: Let’s take a peek at the Pokémon you found with your party.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_2
TEXT: Wow, look at that! Another win for teamwork, I’d say.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_3
TEXT: So many things become possible when you work together towards a common goal!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_4
TEXT: I know you and the other Trainers can make even greater discoveries if you join forces again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_1
TEXT: And what a stupendous number of Pokémon you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_2
TEXT: Thanks to you and your party’s hard work, I have plenty to keep me occupied.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_3
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m confident you have many exciting discoveries ahead, both with the Pokémon you’ll find and the people you’ll meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_4
TEXT: After all, exploring the world together is one of life’s greatest adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1
TEXT: I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2
TEXT: Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_3
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks: 
{0}
{1}
{2}
{3}
{4}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_0
TEXT: Wow, great work today! In addition to completing some insightful research, you’ve skillfully helped me document the amazing nature around us and the fascinating migration patterns that Pokémon follow. I have a feeling there’s even more to discover out here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_1
TEXT: The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0
TEXT: What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1
TEXT: Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2
TEXT: Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3
TEXT: Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4
TEXT: Can you explain this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5
TEXT: I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6
TEXT: So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7
TEXT: I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0
TEXT: How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1
TEXT: I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2
TEXT: Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3
TEXT: I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1
TEXT: I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2
TEXT: Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3
TEXT: They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4
TEXT: I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5
TEXT: Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1
TEXT: Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3
TEXT: My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4
TEXT: I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5
TEXT: How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6
TEXT: This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! What’ve you been up to? Catching Pokémon? Exploring a new Route, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_1
TEXT: As for me, I’ve been absorbed in reading a research article about the Order Pokémon, Zygarde.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_2
TEXT: The writer hypothesizes that Zygarde monitors the ecosystem from deep within the cave where it lives. And when the ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if it ventures outside for other reasons. Here’s an idea for a paper: “Zygarde Habitats and Migration Patterns”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_4
TEXT: What do you think? I wonder what other activities and locales might interest Zygarde...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_5
TEXT: Try to come up with a few theories while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_1
TEXT: While you were out, I caught up on observational reports from local Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_2
TEXT: Curiously, several mentioned amorphous, green blobs they found along Routes. Some Trainers even thought they might be alive!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_3
TEXT: I have a theory about what those wobbly blobs might be, but I’d like to review my research materials first. Maybe even reread that article from earlier...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_4
TEXT: In the meantime, please continue your fieldwork. I’m positive I’ll have a less amorphous update by the time you get back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_5
TEXT: Oh, and I suggest you power up your Pokémon, just in case you run into anything unexpected out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_0
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ll never guess what happened!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_1
TEXT: As I combed through my notes, I saw something blur past me and come to a screeching halt outside the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_2
TEXT: It moved fast, but I’m almost positive it was the very Pokémon I’ve been investigating: Zygarde!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_3
TEXT: It might still be there. Check it out, and here—take this. I’ll explain how to use it once you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_0
TEXT: Incredible, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_1
TEXT: So it really was Zygarde!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_2
TEXT: Zygarde is a curious Pokémon. It’s made of Zygarde Cells, and its appearance depends on the number of cells it has gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_3
TEXT: I’d say this one has about 10% of its cells. It’ll change and grow as it collects more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_4
TEXT: And that’s what my gift is for! The Zygarde Cube can be used to store the Zygarde Cells that you find. You can think of it as a nest for those cells.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_5
TEXT: And as for where can you find those cells... Do you recall those green blobs that have been found along Routes? I reckon they were, in fact, Zygarde Cells!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_6
TEXT: Could I ask you to test that hypothesis, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_0
TEXT: Excellent work finding your first Zygarde Cell, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_1
TEXT: You’re off to a great start to assembling Zygarde’s forms, but there’s a long journey ahead of you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_2
TEXT: It looks like this Zygarde needs to collect 250 cells to reach its Complete Forme. It seems the cells are only gathering along Routes, so you’ve got a lot of traveling in your future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_3
TEXT: I can’t wait for you to get started—just think of all the Pokémon and friends you’ll meet on the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_4
TEXT: Explore a few more Routes, and I suggest you use an Incense while you’re out there. We’ve got to keep up with our studies of other Pokémon as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_1
TEXT: You traveled five entire Routes?! Well done! That adventurous spirit is what makes you such a joy to work with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_2
TEXT: I’m sure Zygarde appreciates your perseverance too. And your efforts will be well-rewarded! In its Complete Forme, Zygarde has enough power to overwhelm even Xerneas or Yveltal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_3
TEXT: Zygarde can radiate high-powered energy from the orifice on its chest. It uses force to neutralize those who harm the ecosystem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_4
TEXT: That’s some good motivation for us to each do our part, eh? Even little things, like recycling when we can. But I don’t think we should need a threat to want to care for our surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_5
TEXT: After all, Pokémon and even Trainers like yourself do their best in a healthy environment—we should all work hard to make the world a place where everyone can thrive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_6
TEXT: I’ll leave you with that thought, %PLAYERNAME%. Smooth travels on your journey to gather Zygarde Cells, and let me be the first to know when you’ve collected enough to see its Complete Forme. I’ll be waiting on the edge of my seat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_2
TEXT: We still don’t know what their plans are for the Dynamax phenomenon, but whatever they are, those three will be carrying them out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_11_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_12_dialogue_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_2
TEXT: We’ll need to keep a close eye on Team GO Rocket as we keep up our research on the Dynamax phenomenon, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_2
TEXT: Gigantamaxed Pokémon seem to not only have altered size and appearance, but they also gain the ability to use a new move. This move seems to be unique to a given species of Gigantamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_16_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: I was out for my daily stroll when I stumbled upon a group of fascinating Pokémon I’d never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: I’ve been poring over my research materials, but so far I haven’t turned up any records about these particular Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: And so, I turn to the power of networking! I’m hoping that I can unravel this mystery by reaching out to my fellow Pokémon Professors. Maybe one of them will know something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_5

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2
TEXT: Galar Calling (2/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_1
TEXT: So Grookey caught your eye! I’ve learned that this spirited little Grass type strikes everything in sight with its trusty stick.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_2
TEXT: The rhythms it makes with that stick grow more lively as it has more and more fun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_3
TEXT: I’ll bet Grookey would make an incredible partner for someone who likes to dance! So shimmy on out there and find one! ...If shimmying is your thing, that is.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Aha, the fiery Scorbunny has “sparked” your interest, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve noted that this energetic Fire type does warm-up exercises to help heat up its body and unleash its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_3
TEXT: Sounds like having Scorbunny by your side would give you the perfect workout buddy! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Head on out there and make yourself a fiery new friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_1
TEXT: Sobble is a wonderful choice, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve learned that this Water type has a unique defense mechanism: it bursts into tears when frightened.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_3
TEXT: Oh, but these waterworks don’t just soften hearts—Sobble’s tears pack the punch of 100 onions, causing its attackers to weep!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about you track down a Sobble so you’ve got a shoulder to cry on? Er, to...make you cry on? I’ll work on that one...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3
TEXT: Galar Calling (3/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_1
TEXT: You got one! My curious side loves seeing Grookey up close, but the rest of me thinks we ought to steer clear of its stick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve got good news, too—a fellow professor shared their research with me. Did you know that when Grookey evolves into Thwackey, it gains a second stick?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_3
TEXT: It makes skillful use of those twin sticks not only to drum out rapid beats, but also to pummel opponents in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about we try to help your little rockstar evolve so we can learn even more about Thwackey’s musical talents?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hello to you, and hello to your new friend, Scorbunny! Excellent work catching it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve got good news, too—a fellow professor shared their research with me. I was just reading up on Scorbunny’s Evolution, Raboot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_3
TEXT: Did you know that they kick berries right off tree branches and juggle them with their feet? It’s a way to practice footwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Now that’s something I’ve just got to see! And who wouldn’t want the chance to enjoy some delicious berries in the name of research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_5
TEXT: How about you help your Scorbunny evolve into Raboot?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_1
TEXT: Now that you’ve made a new friend in Sobble, let’s take a few moments to indulge in the delights of learning!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_2
TEXT: And on that front, I’ve got news that WON’T make you cry—a fellow professor sent me their research. From it, I learned that when Sobble evolves into Drizzile, it becomes quite lazy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_3
TEXT: But don’t let that laziness fool you. Drizzile is highly intelligent and will defend its territory by laying traps for its enemies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_4
TEXT: A clever Pokémon like that sounds like something we need to know more about, so why don’t you work on evolving your Sobble?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve been reading, and I’ve found some great stuff on Thwackey’s Evolution, Rillaboom!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_3
TEXT: Apparently, when two of them meet, they’ll engage in a drumming battle to decide who will lead their troop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about we do some firsthand observation and help your Thwackey evolve? I’ll bet you and Rillaboom would really hit it off!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s quite an impressive Raboot! I bet it’s really been heating things up with its fancy footwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_2
TEXT: But save your applause until you see its final Evolution, Cinderace. It juggles pebbles with its feet and turns them into blazing soccer balls that scorch opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_3
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to be goalie—or the net, for that matter—with Cinderace on the field! But I do think we should “net” ourselves some new data and evolve your Raboot into Cinderace.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Just think of the fiery spectacle you’ll get to enjoy alongside your new friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_1
TEXT: You’re back! And you’ve got a Drizzile in tow! Let’s take a closer look.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_2
TEXT: Did you know that its long, slimy tongue can move at blinding speeds to attack enemies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_3
TEXT: And when it evolves into Inteleon, it gains even more incredible abilities—like fingertips that can shoot water at Mach 3!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_4
TEXT: That sounds like something we ought to see. Why don’t you continue your adventure and evolve your Drizzile into Inteleon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_5

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_3
TEXT: There’s an enormous Pokémon in it! Truly HUMUNGOUS! And it’s not the only one—I’ve received reports of these massive Pokémon showing up all over the place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6
TEXT: Galar Calling (6/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_2
TEXT: And on top of that, we’ve learned that the locations with the strange lights are an entirely new occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_3
TEXT: Honestly, those Power Spots give me tingles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7
TEXT: Galar Calling (7/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, this Dynamax discovery of ours is no small thing. It’s as though every detail we learn leads to new questions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_2
TEXT: How did the Power Spots form? How much stronger are these Pokémon? Do Dynamax Pokémon have equally “maxed” appetites? Hoo boy, we might need to stock up on Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_3
TEXT: In any case, we need to keep thinking big and tracking down these gargantuan Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_2
TEXT: Those troublemakers are up to something. I’m sure of it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_3
TEXT: Are you able to investigate?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_1
TEXT: Glad you’re back. I’ve been reviewing these Team GO Rocket reports, and I think I’ve pieced together something troubling.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_2
TEXT: The evidence suggests that they’re trying to take advantage of the Dynamax phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can you imagine the chaos if they could harness that kind of power? We can’t let that happen!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_10_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_1_dialogue_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_1_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_2_dialogue_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket might know something about why this is happening. While I was out, I saw that their leaders were up to something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_2_dialogue_3
TEXT: We need to get to the bottom of this, even if that means getting close to Team GO Rocket to crack the case.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_2_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_2
TEXT: He found Pokémon in habitats that very much aren’t where they’d normally be observed, similar to when we were chasing down Sierra before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_3
TEXT: Ice-type Pokémon in hot locales, and Fire-type Pokémon in cold locales... Why could something so unexpected like this be happening?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_2
TEXT: I am particularly intrigued by the latest instance we encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_3
TEXT: Both Blanche and Cliff sought innovation in battling, yet one took a defensive stance, and the other turned to the pursuit of power alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_2
TEXT: Intriguing. Perhaps that is the key, then, to understanding these recent events.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_3
TEXT: All things have two sides. Focusing on only one of those sides is unlikely to yield good results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let us look to the future. Experience suggests we may soon receive word from the professor regarding Candela or the last Team GO Rocket leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_1
TEXT: Perfect—now we have a clear picture of what Candela and Arlo were up to.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_2
TEXT: Candela was focused on cooperation, whereas Arlo went in the opposite direction. In the end, they both learned a bit about balance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_3
TEXT: Some people make the best of the strengths and relationships that they have. Others focus on shaping the world to their own ideals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_4

TEXT: That said, I think I’ve managed to come up with a theory that makes sense of it all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_3

TEXT: And the source? None other than Kyurem, a Legendary Pokémon whose frozen body produces ultracold air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_3
TEXT: Intriguingly, Kyurem is closely associated with two other Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom. Each of them seems to have distinct perspectives: one focused on truth, the other on ideals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_4
TEXT: It reminds me of the strange phenomena we’ve been seeing lately. These Legendary Pokémon must be connected to it all somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_5
TEXT: You’d better be ready though, %PLAYERNAME%. Kyurem is no pushover, and I have a feeling you’ll be facing it before long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: I just heard from Spark, %PLAYERNAME%! He just found a research hot spot—literally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: The place is supposed to be pretty toasty, but reportedly the area has plenty of Ice-type Pokémon despite the heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: And that’s not the only news. We’ve pinpointed Sierra’s location too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: She’s been spotted out in the snow, amidst—bafflingly—Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_5
TEXT: Which lead do you want to follow? Would you rather help Spark with his research, or track down Sierra?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_1
TEXT: Fancy seeing you out here in the cold, dear. These Fire types aren’t the only ones whose presence is curious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’m aware that your professor has been attempting to track me down, but I would love to complete my mission. Ideally without your presence.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_3
TEXT: The weather is frigid. This is no place for your frailty.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_4
TEXT: Leave, or I’m afraid I’ll need to take further action. I prefer you simply stop interfering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_1
TEXT: Heyyy, %PLAYERNAME%! How’s it going?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_2
TEXT: Me? I just got back from the beach, and—get this—so did all these Ice-type Pokémon! Weird with the heat, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_3
TEXT: It was fun to beach it up with some new friends, but both the professor and I would love to figure out why they were there in the first place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let’s kick back, relax, and learn a thing or two about staying frosty.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_1
TEXT: Congratulations on a display of mild competence. That’s more than I can say for your friends, especially that airhead, Spark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_2
TEXT: The cause of this phenomenon must be something we haven’t encountered before. However, I don’t recall agreeing to share the rest of my report with you, darling.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_3
TEXT: If you truly think you know what you’re doing, why not continue your little investigation on your own? Now, you must excuse me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’m done with this mission—and with you. Ta-ta, %PLAYERNAME%. Don’t think I’ll go easy on you the next time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_1
TEXT: Radical researching! Not only do I feel totally refreshed, but I learned a lot from my beachside retreat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_2
TEXT: Based on this data, the weird weather that’s been happening lately isn’t linked to anything we’ve seen before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_3
TEXT: It’s electrifying, right? Like we’re incubating a mysterious Egg. Who knows what’s going to pop out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’m jazzed to share our findings with Professor Willow and the others. See ya later, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: Isn’t it nice having friends you can count on, %PLAYERNAME%? You know the feeling well, don’t you, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: Speaking of which, I saw Candela checking on other Trainers and their Pokémon earlier. Her fire comes from understanding that working together makes us stronger than we are on our own!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can’t say the same for Arlo, though. He zipped off on his own, and I hear even the other Team GO Rocket folks don’t know what he’s up to.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: Those two seem like complete opposites, but I’m guessing we’ll learn more soon enough. Which leader would you like to follow this go-around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Can’t you see I’m busy? These interruptions are an immense waste of my time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_2
TEXT: All these Grunts keep fumbling my perfect plans because they can’t follow the simplest instructions. The last thing I need is you tugging at my hem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_3
TEXT: Someone like you could never understand what I’m trying to do here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_4
TEXT: This is your first and final warning: I won’t tolerate your meddling. Leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_1
TEXT: My friends are my fire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_2
TEXT: You, Professor Willow, Rhi—and especially Spark and Blanche—all know how to bring out the best in me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_3
TEXT: Not to mention my trusty Pokémon! Ponyta has always fueled my passion to train and improve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_4
TEXT: And all this weird weather has me thinking... I’m not scared of the heat—I won’t let anything happen to the people and Pokémon I care about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_5
TEXT: We’re stronger together. If we focus on that, we can take whatever comes next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Tch. I can finally wrap up this nonsense. Did you enjoy wasting your time with those Grunts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_2
TEXT: Hmph. Perhaps there’s merit in having some minions keep the worst distractions at bay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_3
TEXT: See if you can wrap your head around this. Do you know the Pokémon Parasect?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_4
TEXT: It looks like a bug, but the mushroom growing on its back does all the thinking. Those Grunts are the bug. I am the mushroom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_5
TEXT: Perhaps having a few bugs around is acceptable, as long as everyone remembers who the mushroom is.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_1
TEXT: So I noticed something while we were researching. A lot of wild Pokémon do stuff that’s mutually beneficial...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_2
TEXT: But give-and-take doesn’t mean they only rely on others. Many can—and do—thrive on their own, as independent creatures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_3
TEXT: Like using one candle to light another. That doesn’t make the first one burn any less bright.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_4
TEXT: I can’t guess what’s coming next, but I gotta trust that my friends have the strength to make it out OK, whether they’re on their own or at my side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_5
TEXT: And that includes you, %PLAYERNAME%! I know you’ve gone up against stuff I can’t even imagine...but I wanna be there to help—if and when you need me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: We’ve got a fresh lead, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: The latest intel suggests that Cliff has been training like there’s no tomorrow, and supposedly he’s got a new strategy: all-out attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Blanche has had a research breakthrough and wants to cultivate the abilities of Pokémon with potent defense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: Attack and defense, opposite but complementary—just like last time. I bet we can learn more about this duality if we dig in a bit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_5
TEXT: On that note, let’s hear it—which of their strategies do you want to investigate further?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_1
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. Your assistance will be most welcome.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_2
TEXT: My research has led me to one conclusion: obvious though it may seem, the surest way to win a battle is to never lose it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_3
TEXT: In other words, if your Pokémon never faints, victory is the only possible outcome.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_4
TEXT: Lapras and I have begun testing several methodologies that maximize its defense potential. Would you and your Pokémon partners like to join us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hey, watch where you’re standing! I’m training here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_2
TEXT: The full-power attacks I’m working on will make Team GO Rocket unstoppable. What’s with that look? Don’t believe it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_3
TEXT: It’s easy. You get your Pokémon to hit so hard that their opponents never even get a CHANCE to hit back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_4
TEXT: Hmph, not that it matters for you. I doubt a weakling like you could ever get your Pokémon to pull an attack like that off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_5
TEXT: And that means if you’re hanging around here, you’re holding me back. So beat it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_1
TEXT: Congratulations on a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_2
TEXT: My analysis of recent battles has disproven my previous theory—though the fault does not lie with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_3
TEXT: I had Lapras so focused on defense that I neglected to give it opportunities to attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_4
TEXT: I fear I’ve stymied its growth. The logical next step is to provide Berries, praise, and—critically—a more well-rounded training regimen.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_5
TEXT: Further work can wait until after we rest, though. %PLAYERNAME%, if you’ve taught me anything today, it’s the importance of a balanced approach.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hrm. Strength reigns supreme, but something’s still missing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_2
TEXT: The problem with only focusing on attacks is that it makes you let your guard down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_3
TEXT: Maybe the boss would prefer it if I used offense AND defense...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_4
TEXT: This won’t stop me, though! I’ll master the power of balance for Team GO Rocket, no matter what it takes!

TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%. It’s wonderful to see you here! This is one of my favorite cities, and it’s popular with other Pokémon Trainers, too!

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_00_01
TEXT: In fact, there was a large gathering of Trainers here some time ago, just as some species of Pokémon that aren’t commonly found in the area happened to be appearing.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_00_02
TEXT: And wouldn’t you know it, those Pokémon are also appearing now! Let’s see if we can find them.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_01_00

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_01_01
TEXT: That’s the spirit! Let’s get to it.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_01_02
TEXT: We can start by checking out those PokéStops over there.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_02_00
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a Pokémon that you don’t usually see in these parts.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_02_01
TEXT: Funnily enough, I remember seeing it around here during that previous gathering of Trainers I mentioned.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_02_02
TEXT: What other Pokémon do you think we’ll spot today?

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_03_00

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_03_02

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_04_00

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_04_01
TEXT: That Pokémon was also spotted during that previous gathering!

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_04_02

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_04_03
TEXT: Whatever the case, it couldn’t have met a nicer Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_05_00
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m sure that Pokémon will have a great time adventuring with you.

RESOURCE ID: safari_city_leave_behind_dialog_05_01

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: I really hope Shaymin hasn’t found itself in any trouble!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! We’re off to a great start already.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: That sounds good to me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_4
TEXT: Something else just occurred to me. Do you think Team GO Rocket will try to capture Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_5
TEXT: The thought of something happening to that sweet little Pokémon is almost too much to bear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_6
TEXT: Well, now that your team’s powered up, we can stop Team GO Rocket before they even get started. Let’s get out there and scare them off, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Thanks for taking care of those Team GO Rocket members.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Now that the area’s safe, we can really focus on our search for Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: After meeting with the team leaders, I’ve learned that Shaymin sightings are happening around the world! Since we can’t be everywhere all at once, let’s start the search right here, where we are.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_4
TEXT: The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_5
TEXT: My current theory is that Shaymin will appear wherever Trainers are feeling thankful. With that in mind, why don’t you and your Buddy Pokémon try challenging a raid?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_6
TEXT: Perhaps Shaymin will sense the gratitude you feel for your Pokémon and the other Trainers battling at your side.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_1
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if we got everything on the first try?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_2
TEXT: I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new intel. In the meantime, let’s think of other ways we can encourage Shaymin to appear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_3
TEXT: What if you try battling some other Trainers? Perhaps Shaymin will sense the bonds of gratitude between you and your Pokémon team. Give it a try, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_0

TEXT: It’s always exciting to meet new Pokémon, but it’s important to make time for the ones that have supported us all along. After all, we’d be lost without them!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_2
TEXT: Much like I’d be lost without your unwavering support. Thanks as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_3
TEXT: Now, why don’t you spend some time with your Buddy Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course! They’re a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin is out getting to know the nearby Pokémon. Try catching a few and see if you can spot Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: I appreciate you entertaining my hypothesis, though. Perhaps we can try luring Shaymin out with some Pinap Berries next? That would certainly work for me... Haha!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back! No Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if everything came easily?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_3_6

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_find_shaymin_narrative_section_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: This year’s festivities are already off to an incredible start—I’m receiving reports that the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin has been sighted nearby!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: The flowers on Shaymin’s body are said to burst into bloom when Shaymin is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude. Believe me, it’s not every day you see Shaymin around!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin’s appearance is somehow related to the island guardians...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: Or... What if Shaymin’s appeared in response to how thankful I am for all your help lately! Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, after all.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: I’m also thankful that you’re here today to enjoy the celebrations. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: I’m sure you’re eager to start searching for Shaymin, so I won’t keep you. Something tells me it’s going to be an exciting day!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_0
TEXT: Splendid, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve brought back Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: Once you’re better friends, I hope you’ll hug it so we can see its flowers burst into bloom!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: As always, thanks for helping me with today’s research! Your contributions are truly invaluable.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I’d like to give you a hug myself—but I spilled some Pinap Juice on myself earlier, so I think I’ll keep my stickiness to myself.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: I want to hear all about how you found Shaymin, but first—have you noticed what’s appeared in the sky?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: Those gaping anomalies appear reminiscent of Hoopa’s rings, but also quite different. A bit like...black holes, perhaps? No—wormholes? What could be on the other side, I wonder? Is this why Alola’s island guardians have been appearing?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: My mind is buzzing with all the possibilities! Though, I think we should tackle this tomorrow. Today’s been plenty exciting.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_8

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_9

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_0
TEXT: Hello! Looks like you’re already all warmed up.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_1
TEXT: Before we continue, I’d like your opinion on something very important.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_2
TEXT: What’s your preferred method of searching for Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_3
TEXT: Great choice, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_0
TEXT: Ah—hello.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_1
TEXT: Or, hmm... Would “what is up” be an acceptable greeting in this circumstance? I have been told the humans of this world are fond of such parlance.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_10
TEXT: This world is mysterious. Would you assist me in expanding my knowledge of it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_11
TEXT: Thank you. I am fortunate to have found someone so kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_12
TEXT: Tell me all about your world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_13
TEXT: Together, perhaps we can expose why the Ultra Wormholes have materialized in your world and mitigate the anomalies that result.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_2
TEXT: It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_3
TEXT: You are a...Pokémon Trainer, is it? I am familiar with the concept.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_4
TEXT: I apologize if I appear awkward. You are the first human I’ve met in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_5
TEXT: Do you see that hole in the sky? That is called an Ultra Wormhole, a tear in space that leads to a world very different from yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_6
TEXT: In fact, I’ve traveled through that wormhole myself, in order to research its appearance and assist with any resulting anomalies occurring in your world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_7
TEXT: Hm? You have a concern?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_8
TEXT: I see. This “Professor Willow” failed to appear before you, is it? I’m unfamiliar with any such individual, but I understand the concern that arises when a companion is missing.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_9
TEXT: I will assist you in your search. In return, however, I would ask a favor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_0
TEXT: Wah tee sup, Pokémon Trainer? Hmm... That feels incorrect.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance thus far. Shall we turn our attention to other objectives?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_10
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_2
TEXT: First, we must find out what caused the Ultra Wormholes to appear in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_3
TEXT: Second, we must keep watch for anything that may travel through them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_4
TEXT: And third, we must find your missing Willow friend.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_5
TEXT: But before all of that, a question: what are those large, towering structures spread throughout the area? They seem to sometimes be blue or red or yellow, and they’re far larger than what you said are “PokéStops.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_6
TEXT: “Gyms,” is it? And Pokémon Trainers gather there to challenge powerful Pokémon in “Raid Battles”? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_7
TEXT: Tell me everything you know about these Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_8
TEXT: They seem to serve as nexus between powerful creatures and humans.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_9
TEXT: If it is acceptable to you, I would like to start by focusing our efforts there.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_0
TEXT: Thank you for shining a light on the concept of Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer. In return, I will confide in you what I know about the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_1
TEXT: Ultra Wormholes are portals into Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_10
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_11
TEXT: If that person was the Willow professor you’re searching for, the GO Ultra Recon Squad will no doubt come to their aid. Such is our purpose.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_12
TEXT: In the between time, I will remain here to provide assistance and illuminate any truths I can.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_13
TEXT: Let us continue to help each other, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_2
TEXT: These dimensional passageways allow creatures known as Ultra Beasts to spill into worlds they don’t belong—and they are fiercely strong.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_3
TEXT: Ultra Beasts are similar to the creatures you call Pokémon—but to your eyes, I imagine they might appear...somewhat different than what you’re accustomed.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_4
TEXT: As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_5
TEXT: The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_6
TEXT: It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_7
TEXT: I’d like to subdue it before it causes trouble for anyone in this world. Can I beg your help in this undertaking?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_8
TEXT: I have no experience in Pokémon battles. Where I come from, Pokémon are shared.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_9
TEXT: Furthermore, there are indications that someone from this world was sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. If that is true, that person could be in tremendous danger.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_0
TEXT: To what are you up, Pokémon Trainer? That...that’s not it, is it? *sigh* I see you have caught many Ground-type Pokémon. May I ask why?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_1
TEXT: They’re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pokémon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_2
TEXT: I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_3
TEXT: We can tell each other more about our worlds as we go.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_4
TEXT: I am once again thankful to have acquainted myself with someone so cordial.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_5
TEXT: There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_6
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_0
TEXT: A question, Pokémon Trainer—who are those people with the large red Rs on their clothes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_1
TEXT: Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they’re friends of yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_3
TEXT: Their presence unnerves me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_4
TEXT: If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_0
TEXT: Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pokémon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_1
TEXT: May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_2
TEXT: Hm? Ultra Beasts aren’t the only creatures you’ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_3
TEXT: I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_4
TEXT: The Alola region... I’ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven’t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_0
TEXT: Shall we pause, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_1
TEXT: This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize—I’ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_2
TEXT: How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_3
TEXT: I see... Spending time with your Pokémon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_4
TEXT: I am enchanted by these “Incubators” that you place Eggs within.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_5
TEXT: They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_6
TEXT: Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_7
TEXT: Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you—but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_8
TEXT: To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Poké Ball...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_0
TEXT: You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_1
TEXT: You seem unafraid of the unknown. It’s an admirable trait.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_2
TEXT: Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_3
TEXT: I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_4
TEXT: In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures—and not easily controlled.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_5
TEXT: Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_6
TEXT: And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pokémon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_7
TEXT: A “snapshot,” is it? What a delight.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_8
TEXT: Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_0
TEXT: Your world is almost blindingly bright—and more verdant than I’ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_1
TEXT: Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_10
TEXT: Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_11
TEXT: Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_12
TEXT: You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be—

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_13
TEXT: Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pokémon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_2
TEXT: Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world’s new dilemma.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_3
TEXT: And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There’s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_4
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors—it is only fair.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_5
TEXT: If this man is anything like you’ve described, I have no doubt he’ll be well in the end.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_6
TEXT: So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return—but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_7
TEXT: For now, I’ll see what else I can do to assist you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_8

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—today we’re learning all about the Johto region and meeting some Pokémon originally discovered there, too!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: But nothing’s happened yet, so you just focus on having fun with your friends and your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: The Johto region is a land steeped in history and tradition, where the bygone beauty of Ecruteak City lies just steps away from the modern metropolis of Goldenrod City.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: It’s also the region where Dark- and Steel-type Pokémon were first discovered! Not to mention Mr. Pokémon and the mysterious Mystery Egg.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region, I’ve heard tell that Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon, has been seen nearby.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Celebi has the ability to move through time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: I still can’t shake the feeling that Celebi had something to do with Hisuian Voltorb appearing in our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: In any case, rumor has it this Celebi knows a special move. I hope we’ll get a chance to see if that’s true!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: While you enjoy today’s festivities, keep vigilant for any signs of Team GO Rocket. I know I haven’t forgotten about them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_9
TEXT: Hopefully we can get some insight into what they’ve been up to since they smashed open that mysterious door...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: You know what your adventure needs, %PLAYERNAME%? A new buddy! I spoke with a colleague and was able to orchestrate a little surprise for you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: These Pokémon are the first partner Pokémon offered to Trainers in the Johto region. Go on—pick one!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: I think that’s a great Pokémon, too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_chikorita
TEXT: Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon, is docile and loves to soak up the sun’s rays. A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on its head. Doesn’t it have just the most adorable face?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_cyndaquil
TEXT: Cyndaquil, the Fire Mouse Pokémon, is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection. Doesn’t its shyness make you want to cuddle it even more?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_totodile
TEXT: Totodile, the Big Jaw Pokémon, is small but rough and tough. It won’t hesitate to take a bite out of anything that moves. Though what’s the harm in one quick pet...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure this little one is eager to spend some time with you, and what better way than letting it join you on your Johto-inspired journey!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_chikorita
TEXT: Wow, your Chikorita evolved into Bayleef already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_cyndaquil

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_totodile
TEXT: Wow, your Totodile evolved into Croconaw already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket is mobilizing—and they’re headed straight toward us!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I have a feeling they’re stirring up more than just a mild bit of mischief... That must be why they’re launching an invasion—more distractions! Not to mention they always love to crash our parties.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Have they heard about the Celebi sightings? Or maybe they have something even more sinister up their sleeve...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: I’m going to need your help defeating some Team GO Rocket Grunts—distract the distraction, and buy me some time to investigate. Can I count on your help?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Magnificent work, %PLAYERNAME%! While I was investigating, some Team GO Rocket Grunts ran by, whining about losing to an “unfairly strong Trainer.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: I assume you’re the Trainer in question? Haha, but of course! I knew I could trust you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn’t at all like your typical Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: This one seems like it’s mired in a fit of rage—not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region’s Lake of Rage.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Hm. That sounds similar to Shadow Pokémon, don’t you think? And there have been a lot more Shadow Pokémon appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: And is this connected to what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they’ve now amplified and corrupted...?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_7
TEXT: And with Celebi about and its time travel powers— Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There’s no time to waste. Let’s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it’s too late!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you’ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It looks like Team GO Rocket’s retreating as well, so how about we continue with our festivities? They’ve stolen enough of our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_chikorita

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_totodile
TEXT: I think your Croconaw would like to play with you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Even in the direst of situations, when you’re pulled from all sides, it’s essential to take time to decompress and enjoy a peaceful moment with your friends.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: Times like that give us the strength to persevere.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_chikorita

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I’d have never found that mysterious door if not for a random adventure! Despite Team GO Rocket’s interference, I’m still grateful for the time I got to spend with the team leaders and the research I was able to do.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_3

TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, sorry to rush you, but we have to hurry! There’s been a confirmed Celebi sighting just moments ago. If you go now, you might be able to catch it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_0
TEXT: Great work catching Celebi! It is thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_1
TEXT: I wonder why Celebi decided to appear to us today. Maybe it’s a sign of good things to come.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: After all the trouble we’ve had with Team GO Rocket, I welcome the reminder that peaceful times aren’t too far off.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: While you were out, I uncovered the truth Team GO Rocket has been trying so hard to hide: they’ve captured Lugia and Ho-Oh.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they’ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pokémon we’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: They’re calling them Apex Shadow Lugia and Apex Shadow Ho-Oh. Get ready, %PLAYERNAME%—the battle’s only just begun.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d you enjoy yesterday’s festivities? I hope you’re still feeling energetic, because there’s more in store—and this time, we’re focusing on the Kanto region!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: What better place to start one’s Pokémon adventure, no?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s get out there and start exploring!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re looking a bit tired. Why not take a quick break? Play with your buddy a bit, maybe feed it a nice juicy Berry?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: While you’re at it, why not grab a snack yourself! Even the strongest Trainers can’t run on an empty stomach.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Having fun, %PLAYERNAME%? Are you all warmed up for your next adventure? I hope so, because you’ll soon be exploring the area’s different habitats.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: There are five habitats, each filled with unique Pokémon. Which habitats have which Pokémon, you ask? Well, let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Nice snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%! You really captured the essence of the Pokémon, and it looks like the little models were having a good time, too.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy your excursion through the habitats? I bet you encountered an immense amount of Pokémon, both familiar and new to you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There are tons of amazing Trainers out here exploring as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Why not make a few new friends, then trade or battle with them?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were out, I heard that a powerful Legendary Pokémon has been sighted in the area.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: Maybe it heard about our festivities and wanted to join the fun? Let’s go check it out!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Whoa! Is that...Mewtwo? Incredible! Will the world’s wonders never cease?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: This has been such a fun day, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you enjoy the rest of your adventure—there’s still plenty more to do. Until next time...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re just the person I was looking for!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_0_1
TEXT: We’ve had a whole mess of Team GO Rocket Grunts hanging around lately. I even heard some of them bragging about finding a Dynamax Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_0_2
TEXT: I shudder to think of what it could mean if those miscreants actually got their mitts on it! Would you mind checking things out?

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_0_3
TEXT: I know that if push comes to shove, you’ll show them who’s boss!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_1_0
TEXT: My hypothesis was correct—you sent those pesky Grunts packing! Well done, my friend!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_1_1
TEXT: And I see you were able to catch the Pokémon they had their eyes on, too: a Kubfu that can Dynamax!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_1_2
TEXT: You see that long white hair on its head? Supposedly, if Kubfu pulls on it, it makes its fighting spirit heighten and power well up from the depths of its belly!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_1_3
TEXT: I think it recognized your skill and wants to join you on your journey so it can get stronger. No surprise, really—you made quick work of those Team GO Rocket troublemakers.

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_1_4
TEXT: So go on, get to adventuring and help Kubfu reach its full potential!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_2_0
TEXT: There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! It looks like Kubfu is working hard under your expert eye.

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_2_1
TEXT: I imagine it’s very diligent when it comes to training both body and mind. But watch out—soon, the student may become the master!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_2_3
TEXT: On that note, every master-in-training should know their strengths and weaknesses. What do you think those are for Kubfu?

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_2_4
TEXT: Let’s discuss that when you return from your next training session. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you discovered Kubfu’s strengths and weaknesses?

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_3_1
TEXT: Kubfu is a Fighting-type Pokémon, so it’s strong against Normal, Ice, Rock, Dark, and Steel types.

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_3_2
TEXT: On the other hand, it may have a hard time against Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type attacks. Self-awareness is an important part of mastery!

RESOURCE ID: story_mightandmastery_3_3
TEXT: Thanks to you, it seems Kubfu is learning how to forge its way forward. Keep powering up!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_1

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_2
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve come out on the other side with some exciting treasures: fossils, King’s Rocks, and a trove of maps!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_3
TEXT: It’s hard to determine who or what left the maps behind, especially given their contents. For example, this one apparently leads to “the world’s tastiest Poffin.”

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_4

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_5

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_6
TEXT: What do you say we find out together?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_7

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_0_8

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_1a_2

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_1b_0
TEXT: Great choice! I always enjoy a stroll in the cool, crisp moonlight.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_1b_1

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_1b_2

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2_2

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2_4
TEXT: I, too, find the cycles of the sun and moon fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2_5
TEXT: But I am here for a different matter. I have picked up readings that indicate the presence of something from beyond this world.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2_6
TEXT: I had hoped to request your company, but your research for Professor Willow comes first.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2a_3
TEXT: I see. So you‘ve both been moved to study Pokémon associated with daytime after finding a celestial chart.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2a_7

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_2b_3

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_3_2
TEXT: Rhi was hot on the heels of something otherworldly. We were getting ready to rally the Team Leaders when—get this—a Cosmog blissfully bobbed by!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_3_3
TEXT: You don’t see that every day.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_3_4
TEXT: I recall Rhi mentioning that Cosmog’s gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, but it doesn’t seem to care.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_3_5
TEXT: Even so, we can’t just leave it be. You’d better hurry and catch that Cosmog before it blows into some trouble!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_cosmog_sol23_3_6
TEXT: While you’re doing that, I’ll ponder how another Cosmog found its way here...and whether it was more than luck that we happened to have a map of the stars on this exact day.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_dark_flames_june23_branch_choice_1_3

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_0_1
TEXT: I hear you’ve been a great help with his research. That’s actually how he and I met—out in the field!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_0_2
TEXT: I come from a long line of researchers and love observing Pokémon in different habitats.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_0_3
TEXT: My travels take me all around the world, and I enjoy picking up Gifts from the places I’ve been—as well as sharing those Gifts with the Trainers I meet.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_1
TEXT: I find it invigorating to follow in the figurative footsteps of our fellow explorers and see the world through their eyes.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_2
TEXT: It’s also a great way to pick up Gifts to share with other Trainers!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_3
TEXT: And speaking of Routes, I see you’ve met my good friend Mateo! We go way back. He’s a gold-star guy, and I hope you get to know him as well as I do.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_4
TEXT: By the way, did you see the tape measure Mateo keeps wrapped around his hat?

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_5
TEXT: He keeps it handy to better survey the land he travels and to measure the Pokémon he encounters—especially if they’re small. But I’ll let him tell you more about that.

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_1_6

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_2_2
TEXT: I’ve started doing lunges between Routes, too. Talk about taking a big step forward!

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_2_3

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_3_2

RESOURCE ID: story_quest_mateointro_3_3

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_1

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_2

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_14_2

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_14_3
TEXT: Did you know that Dialga can control time and Palkia can distort space?

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_14_4

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_5_0

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_5_1
TEXT: They’re called the “Adamant Crystal” and the “Lustrous Globe”—treasures from the Sinnoh region that date back to when it was called the Hisui region.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_5_2
TEXT: With names like those, they’re bound to lead to exciting discoveries! Will you join me in learning more about them? I’ll do my own digging while you’re out in the field.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_6_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, I haven’t come across anything like them in my travels.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_6_3
TEXT: Perhaps together, we can learn more about these items and the secrets they may hold.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_6_4

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_7_1
TEXT: I did some independent research while you were in the field.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_7_2
TEXT: While I have not uncovered any true leads, I can at least confirm that the Adamant Crystal and Lustrous Globe are not related to the Ultra Beasts.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_7_3
TEXT: It may feel as if we have reached a dead end, but I am confident that with diligent research, we will learn more soon.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_8_2
TEXT: Thankfully, I was able to find a few hints in some old manuscripts sent to me by colleagues in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_8_3
TEXT: They mentioned that the Adamant Crystal and Lustrous Globe are somehow connected to Dialga and Palkia—Legendary Pokémon originally discovered in the very same Sinnoh region!

RESOURCE ID: story_timeless_travels_8_4
TEXT: I’m gobsmacked by this discovery and can’t wait to learn more.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_0_3

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_1_1

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_1_2

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_1_3
TEXT: In my world, this Ultra Beast is liked well enough to be chosen as a first partner companion.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_1_4
TEXT: It is a mystery as to why this Poipole has ventured so far. Perhaps it even traveled through an Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_1_5

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_2_2

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_2_3

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3
TEXT: World of Wonders (4/5)

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3_0

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3_1
TEXT: And that’s only accounting for the ones we know about. There might still be more out there.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3_2
TEXT: What’s the meaning of all of this? Why are they back? Is our world in danger?

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3_3
TEXT: Their sudden appearance raises a lot of questions, but don’t worry. Rhi and I are committed to figuring out what’s causing this phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_3_4

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_4_1
TEXT: Reports of Ultra Beast sightings continue to arrive, but we have yet to arrive at a conclusive explanation as to why.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_4_2
TEXT: On a related note, the Poipole you encountered intrigues me.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_4_3
TEXT: I suspect that it may be ready to evolve into Naganadel.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_4_4
TEXT: Naganadel is a fascinating Ultra Beast whose unique biology allows it to store hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid within its body.

RESOURCE ID: story_worldofwonders_4_5
TEXT: I digress. The professor and I thank you for your tireless efforts thus far, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_0_0

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_0_1
TEXT: One of my research colleagues recently went on an excavation and came across some unusual diamonds.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_0_2
TEXT: The team suspects these aren’t just any diamonds, but ones created by the Jewel Pokémon Diancie!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_0_3
TEXT: My colleague is sending me samples, and I’m eager to examine them further.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_0_4
TEXT: While we wait for them to arrive, I’ll start prepping some dazzling facts about Diancie to share!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_1_1
TEXT: I’m afraid the samples from my colleague are still in transit, but I promised you Diancie trivia—and I won’t keep you on the edge of your Dian-seat.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_1_2
TEXT: Get this: Diancie can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t that just phenomenal? I wonder how their color and luster compare to other diamonds...

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_2_0
TEXT: Great work out there, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve earned a brain-teaser: which Pokémon is Diancie a sudden transformation of?

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_2_1
TEXT: That’s right—Carbink! Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_2_2
TEXT: That must be an astonishing sight. Do you think that queen is Diancie?

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_2_3
TEXT: Well, as long as we’re still waiting for the samples to arrive, why don’t you explore the area and see if you can locate a Carbink for us to observe?

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_3_0
TEXT: Brilliant work finding a Carbink!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_3_1
TEXT: Here’s something you might not know—Carbink has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_3_2
TEXT: I sure would love to “gleam” insights from such a long-lived Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, I was just notified that the diamond samples from my colleague should be arriving very soon.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_3_4
TEXT: If they’re anything like Diancie itself, prepare yourself for the loveliest sight in the world!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_4_0
TEXT: The samples from my colleague are finally here!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_4_1
TEXT: After some testing, I’ve determined that these are indeed diamonds made by Diancie. Look at that shimmer!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_4_2
TEXT: These diamonds are rare, but catching a glimpse of Diancie is an even more extraordinary event.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_4_3
TEXT: Fun fact: Diancie is a Rock- and Fairy-type Pokémon—an unusual combination indeed!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_4_4
TEXT: Diancie can also Mega Evolve, making it shine even more brilliantly than ever. It really is one devastatingly dazzling Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_5_0
TEXT: Thanks for helping me research Carbink and Diancie!

RESOURCE ID: storyquest_global_diancie_5_1
